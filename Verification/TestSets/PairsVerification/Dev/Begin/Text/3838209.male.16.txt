Lost. Thats where i am....  Where in my life can i find God? I've been pondering this for a long time, and somehow i get the feeing that i've not found him anywhere in my life at all. Looking back, i find my life is corrupted with sin, and the evils of sin still tempt me today, making it so difficult to love the people around me. Sucess, wealth, grades.... they have their value, on Earth, but not in heaven. To the rich man who asked "What must i do to inherit eternal life", Jesus replied, "&nbsp;Give away all your riches&nbsp;and come follow me". Indeed,&nbsp;i acknowledge that nothing&nbsp;bound on Earth can be taken to heaven. But then, i also realise that i've not done anything in my life out of the love Jesus has given to us.  I want to follow Jesus, but i just don't know how. I've stopped praying regularly and have even stopped being attentive at mass. Whats happening to me?   I'm like the lost sheep. Without my shepard, i fall prey easily to the snare of the fowler. My only hope now is that my shepard comes looking for me, and finds me. I want to return to prayer, to be in communion with Christ. And i know that so long as i repent, and follow my shepard home,&nbsp;He&nbsp;still has a place for me.  "He who has never loved, has never known God."
I've become so uncertain about so much recently. About GP, about Chinese, about PW, even about whether i'm treating my friends the way they deserve to be treated. I've also realised how distant i've become from God. Right now, i feel perfectly fine, pretty happy in a&nbsp;way, but empty inside. That only tells me how temporary this pseudo-happiness is. I've become so drawn into the riches of this world, i've not stopped to consider whats really important for the next. Right now, i wish to return to prayer with God, to tell him how sorry i am for leaving his company, for not being a good neighbour, for not appreciating my friends, for not trusting in him, and for even allowing evil thoughts to corrupt me. Sadly, its not easy. I've apparently lost this love for prayer, and i've lost the will power to devote time to God. To my friends, though you may not know it, i've sinned against you in so many ways, in so many thoughts.&nbsp;Please forgive me, and pray for me, that i will return to prayer&nbsp;to seek the&nbsp;Lord, and&nbsp;to answer his&nbsp;voice....&nbsp;
This week was killer, i ended up sleeping past 2 on tuesday, past 1 on wed, and past 2 on thursday again! What was the cause? PW...... Ultimately a big waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But crap, i want to do well for PW, so i guess i gotta work for it. I'm so not in the mood for work........ Can't believe it. On one hand, i'm glad Sat has come, but on the other hand, soon it'll be sunday, and then Monday would be coming round again......... I miss my&nbsp;BPS d
