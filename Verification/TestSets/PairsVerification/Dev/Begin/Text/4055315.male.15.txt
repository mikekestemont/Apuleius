wooh... Saturday's always fun, right? well, I'm babysitting all day, I'm getting two packs of ciggarettes (Camel Turkish blends :) ) and a 24 pack of beer for Mike, Jon, Jereme, and myself, 6 beers each (some might not have all of their's, so more for Jereme and myself! :). yeah... it's really boring at their house, so I brought them to mine... Mike's coming over, and Jon and Jereme are later too. I gotta go though... I'm supposed to watch them, not the computer screen... later.
School, duh... it rained but after I skated with Adam Jon and Jereme from 4 til' 10 at night. I have to babysit tomorrow, from 11 am til' 9 pm :X... I'm talking to Cassandra, my girlfriend of going on two months, and her friend connected with a fly... they locked eyes, he told it to fly away, and it did... but really, what else would it have done? He's probably a stoner... it sounds like a stoner type-thing. Nothing big today...
normal school day, but after I went to Jereme's and built a three set to go along with the box we made, it's 2' tall, about three feet long and it has a ramp that folds off, a rail on top, and a three set [that's freshly built] and stuff. I was throwing wood around [at Jon... I cut his face with a piece] and some landed on Jereme's neighbor's [an old Chinese Guy's] lawn, and he flipped out so fucking much.... on only me, "if there's any wood on my lawn again I'm going to shove it down your throat!" ...so I of course told him that it was funny he had said that and laughed in his face :). Jon, Jereme, and myself left a HUGE mess on his yard so his dad flipped out too... we cleaned it up and left though. We didn't clean up the backroom, which we flooded with the house trying to fill the hottub, or the living room which had food and wrappers all over it too... I have to babysit ALL Saturday, from 11am til' 9pm ...fuck :/ ...later.
Summer school... you know? after I skated for an hour or so, and then began construction of a fun box/mini-quarter pipe at my friend Jereme's house. It's only two feet high... and there's a ramp on it with hinges, so it folds up... tomorrow [if I'm not lazy] will be time to make the mini-quarter pipe, I'm babysitting right now... and theres a three person&nbsp;4 through 7 year old battle going on in my house.... so I'll update next time anything happens. Later.
Apparently... my face is a chew toy, or at least that's what Molly thinks. Summer school was normal, hand in homework... learn something new, quiz on the old, more homework. On the bus ride home, I was throwing objects [batteries, pens, pencils, quarters, etc.] out of the window, and I, along with some other kid got caught and had to stay on the bus, and sweep up the whole bus and clean it out a
