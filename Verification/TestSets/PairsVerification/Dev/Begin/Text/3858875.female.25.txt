Throughout the global South and North there is a growing resistance to privatization, market reform programs, free trade, and imperialist aggression: from anti-privatization demonstrations in El Salvador, to the Zapatista uprising, from the movements of taken factories in Argentina, to thousands marching against Monsanto and Coca Cola in India.  Here in Canada, indigenous peoples are experiencing neoliberalism and corporate globalization as another wave of colonization.
