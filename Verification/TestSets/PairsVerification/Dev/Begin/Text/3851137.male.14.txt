Today I wrote the article about how Firefox kicks IE's BUTT yea. So thats it. OH YEA I found a good site about Trillian. Yea its awesome email me if you want it. My email is OompaKicksButt@Gmail.com
I use FireFox for more then 1 reason and I just thought you might benefit from them if I posted it.  1.) Popup Blocker. Internet Explorer users often get bombarded by popups. I have a built in popup blocker and if I would want to see the pops on one page I just simply press the small icon that appears at the bottom left of the window.  2.) Tabbed Interface. My dad (an avid I.E. user) likes to show me stuff he finds on the internet. When I finally go over to the office to see what he wants to show me I see him going through about 20 different windows just to find it. With Firefox a simple press of ctrl+T opens  a new "tab" which shows up right under my Bookmarks toolbar and has a short description. Right now I see "Oompas Blog. :: Create New Post", "Oompas Blog.", and "Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded". This allows me to update my blog. Check it once I have updated it. And look through the Mozilla website for updates.  3.) Bookmark Toolbar. I see my mom constantly open up her bookmarks on IE to find a game to play. I am just 1 click away from any bookmark I have. Firefox comes with this handy dandy bookmarks toolbar. When you bookmark something it gives you the option to put it into the bookmarks toolbar. Once its their you just click the name you gave your bookmark and boom your at the website.  4.) Customizable Toolbars. Hate how IE is organized? Well I do. So once I got Firefox I just made a new navigation toolbar. It has all I need and not the extra crap I hate. I just right clicked on the main toolbar and clicked customize and just went from their clicked and dragged the options I wanted into the space I wanted and TADA all done and better then ever.  5.) Quick Downloads. In internet explorer you have to go through quite a bit to download something. In Firefox just pick if it should be opened by the default program or saved to the desktop. Then you will get a little download window and if you don't want to see it just exit out of it and the file will still keep downloading.  Well that's it. I hope I can convert some of you IE users.
