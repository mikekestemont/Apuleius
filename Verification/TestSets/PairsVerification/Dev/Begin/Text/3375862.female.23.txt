Last night has confirmed what I always suspected - I am a genius at making prawn curry. Actually it wasn't a prawn curry proper, but a really easy recipe which had the definite virtue of not requiring me to buy anything more taxing than a lemon and some tomato puree - I had everything else in the house - and being staggeringly simple. And I found the recipe on the internet! God bless it.  Tonight I am having what I have so far only been able to define as a 'drinks thing' in a pub, as a sort of leaving Bristol do. I have sent out an e-mail to people I think might like to come, and a few text messages to non-e-mail-type philistines, and that's all, apart from a couple of pleas to close friends not to leave me sitting there all alone at eight this evening... so it might be fifty people or it might be five. We'll have to see. At least one ex-boyfriend is going to be there, possibly with new fiance in tow, which is a bit scary, but he is known to be friendly, as opposed to the sort of hostile ex who only comes to see if you've put on weight and to make sure you know how much more successful they are than you.  Other than that I am packing up my office today - going through files and boxes and throwing away pages and pages of notes it took me years to compile. Ah well.

Actually I sort of have a duty to ensure I never, ever do such a thing... so out they will go, and good riddance to them.

I don't know about that... but I did get a lot done yesterday. All the boring moving house admin stuff, writing letters, pressing numbers and speaking loudly and clearly after the beep... I also schlepped up Park Street with a carrier bag of books in one hand and another five in a rucksack - if you have never been to Park Street, which I strongly recommend for the shopping, be prepared for it to get pretty sodding steep just when you start to lose your puff. I arrived red-faced and dishevelled, and looking almost exactly like the sort of person whose textbooks you don't want to buy back for 50% of their value in vouchers. They still did, though. Fifty pounds' worth of book money!! Heaven!  Apropos of which, I did give myself a bit of a treat, and visited the Green Leaf bookshop on Park Row. It is the kind of place t
