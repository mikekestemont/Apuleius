Today was not a good day.  I forgot my stuff for gym (swimsuit, towel, etc.) AND my gym uniform, so I had to do stairs in a sweater and jeans. It is HOT up there!!! And boring!!! Plus, I can't make it up because I didn't have my uniform? Thats the DUMBEST rule I've ever heard!!!  Then I checked the call-back list for the play and I didn't make it. Not that I expected to (I'm just a freshman) but of COURSE Julie (this girl I don't like) made it. And all my guy-friends. Jeez.  Now I have to finish this assignment my psycho Bio teacher assigned (100 questions about the digstive and excetory systems). And my grandparents are coming over for dinner. I love my grandparents, but that kind of slows things down, gives me less time for stuff I want to do.  @U$#@(*#&@#(*&#!!!!
I had the weirdest dream last night.  Recently, I've been having Lord of the Rings-related dreams, all of them odd, but this one was way odd.  I dreamt that I was a female version of Pippin and that I was in the midst of the battle of the Pelennor fields. But it wasn't the Pelennor fields that the world is now familiar with. It was the main gym at my school, but instead of the bleachers on one of the sides, there was a stage, where everybody was fighting.  I remember trying to look for Gandalf. I ran out of the door, but instead of walking into the hallways of my school, I ran into a maze of white hallways.  Weird, huh?  Yeah, and like a week or so ago I had a different LOTR themed dream. I was on a white couch in an old library (like the kind you'd see in turn of the century mansions). Behind the couch was a door. It opens, and out come these Gollum clones.  That's right. Gollum clones.  Weirder still, they were chanting "We wants it" (exactly like he said it in Two Towers when he was talking to himself the first time) and they surrounded the couch. Then something happened (I think I screamed) and they disappeared. I got off the couch, and looked behind me. There's this HUGE Gollum standing there with this inflated head! I turn to my right, and there's Marianne (a classmate) with a video camera, looking terrified.  I think I'm losing it...
Your ideal Middle-Earth parents are Aragorn and Arwen!  They are the king and queen of Gondor, which makes you a prince or princess.  Not too shabby, huh?  Youll get to take over the kingdom someday.  Look at you, all heir-to-the-throne-y!  Oh, did I mention that you are gorgeous?  Your Middle-Earth mama is practically a supermodel, while your Middle-Earth dad managed to turn heads at eighty-seven years old.  Youve hit the genetic lottery, my friend!  Your last name is Telcontar and you live in the city of Minas Tirith.  Your Middle-Earth mama is Arwen Undomiel.  She is an elf but gave up her immortality to be with your dad.  If you do s
