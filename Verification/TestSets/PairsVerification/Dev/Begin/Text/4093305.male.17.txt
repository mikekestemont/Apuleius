Obviously, this blog mainly concerns war, conflict, and my thoughts and reflections on these subjects.   Throughout the history of mankind, people have been killing each other for reasons mainly concerning power and greed. As can be seen by the world's events, this continues to be the case today. From fighting in Iraq, to genocide in Sudan, to the never-ending Palestinian-Israeli conflicts...the current state of affairs today shows the constant struggles that the likes of Marx and Malcolm X have referred to: "clashes" of "haves" against "have-nots", "oppressors" against "oppressed".    As this is only the first post here, I'll end this now. But before I go, I just have to quote Orwell, the inspiration for the name of this blog, from his essay, "Politics and the English Language" (1946). This quote sums up exactly what I feel about how politicians use a version of Newspeak, covering up mass murders with phrases like "National security" and "Western values." Take it away, George:    In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called  pacification . Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called  transfer of population  or  rectification of frontiers . People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called  elimination of unreliable elements . Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.
I've spent a lot of time changing the look today. I'll have news tomorrow before noon, maybe midnight. I'll make the update extra good.
"ISTANBUL, June 29 -- President Bush criticized unnamed U.S. allies in the Middle East for compromising with extremists and suppressing dissent and called on the Islamic world to move toward democracy as a way to safeguard the United States and reduce violence in the Middle East. 	  Speaking in front of a waterfront mosque, Bush said that leaders throughout the Middle East, "including some friends of the United States, must recognize the direction of the events of the day. Any nation that compromises with violent extremists only emboldens them and invites future violence.  "Suppressing dissent only increases radicalism. The long-term stability of any government depends on being open to change and responsive to citizens."  Bush did not specify which U.S. allies he was referring to, but an aide and outside experts said that Saudi Arabia was a
