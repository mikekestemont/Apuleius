Another minister at our church asked me a question last week that I thought was insightful...  He referred to the story in John 9 where Jesus' followers asked him about a man born blind, and whose sin caused that ailment, the man's or his parent's.  The question was, is being blind inherently a bad thing?  We realized that the question that was asked of Jesus, "Whose sin caused this," assumed that blindness was a bad thing or a punishment that would be the result of sin.  Jesus' answer is great..."It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him be blind. This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him."  I would like to see my weaknesses, as well as those of people around me, as opportunities for God's power to be shown...not just as weaknesses for us to hide or work around...
I love my junior high kids...yesterday we had our first Jr. High only class since I've been working at this church (after two Sundays of cancelled classes because a total of 1 student showed up in two weeks.)  I had a great class planned with group activities and fun stuff, and while we were reading the announcement sheet, we found the verse of the day from Ephesians 6.  When I asked a student to read that for us, he couldn't find it, and then we realized that nobody in the class knew how to find Ephesians.  So...we spent the whole day doing a quick lesson on the NT books and where they came from!  I loved it because they were totally into the lesson, asking questions about it, and seriously interested in where this stuff came from.  I'm really excited to see this hunger in them...may it be an indicator of things to come in the Jr. High group...
Is anyone reading this?  If so, post a comment!  Fished with grandparents today, as well as just hang out time.  Great to be here with them.  Fish were biting, and we caught quite a few of them, but they were all throw backs for being too small.  Went and ate fish at the world-famous King's Inn though, so that made up for it.  Will travel back tomorrow night.
Arrived in Kingsville tonight to see grandparents.  Saw 3 nice bucks on the way up here...all 8 points between Hwy. 35 and Refugio.  Nice to be away from town for a while.  Will probably get to drive on the King Ranch in the next 48 hours, one of my favorite past times.  Also should get to fish...What more could I ask for?  Had a great Bible study today with the high school kids after school.  Focused on anger and how Jesus was able to remain unangry during very frustrating times (betrayal by Judas, disciples who wouldn't stay awake for prayer).  Hope it was helpful to the kids.  Till later...
Frustration today...  When I moved to this city to work with this church, there were 7 or 8 families whose main bread-winner was out of work due t
