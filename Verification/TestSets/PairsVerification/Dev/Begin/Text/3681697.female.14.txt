Im just writting to say that i really really hate blogs they are so boring and stupid.I think that they are ment to be like diarys.Diary's are ment to be secret but everyone always reads them anyway.If your parents say that they havent  read yours dont worry they are most definatly lying all parents cant resist the idea of being able to know your most personal and privte thoughts.Which really does ruin the purpose of having a secret diary in the first place if its not even secret.Its just the same with thoes stupid poem books, people bring to school with dark and 'meaningfull' poems in themthat they 'really' dont want anyone to read,'really'.To help relise there strong emotions. If you dont want anyone to read them then dont bring the to school for people to see.If u ask me its just an attention seaking thing.Its gay and to make matters worse they leave them everywhere no matter which way u turn theres always one there screaing out to u  READ ME,READ ME ,READ ME.And they always have the owners name neatly printed on the front.So u dont get confused about which depressed,suisidal teenager your actually reading about. Opps there goes half the depressed highschool population out of there class rooms and sharpening their pitchforks.with signs saying kill the evil person who insulted our poem books. * i apologise to those of the high school depressed population who wouldnt do this.but hey its a steriotypical world isnt it. If you are a type of person who likes to analise everything then i would strongly advise that you stoped reading right now .I hate people who analise everyhting that you do. Its sooo annoying its like if your annoyed at something that doesnt mean that theres anything behind that.somethings really are jsut in black and white. well thats all im going t
