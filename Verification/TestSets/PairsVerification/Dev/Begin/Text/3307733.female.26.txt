Cyndi is gone for a week in the Bahamas so I'm doing her job as well as mine. The dynamics of the office are a lot different without her around and while it's stressful in someways, it's better in others. I am doing the work she does, but doing it right and trying (albeit only moderately successfully) to not panic when I have so much on my plate. She's leaving in June for a career change since she just graduated and although I'm looking forward to it, I'm also kind of freaked out about it. That means a new person to train, and I think I'll be the one doing some of the training.   Office politics are also interesting. It seems that everyone has a beef with everyone else on some day during the week. I'm just generally bitchy, though I don't mean to be. I'm bringing my day to day life with me to work and I need to stop doing that. Stress in life needs to be seperate from stress at work. That way it won't compound things. Today I started out with a nasty attitude...but talked with Mary and felt better immediately. Tomorrow there's some sort of meeting at 8:30 for the whole company. It seems that we're having a change in the way that insurance is being taken out of our checks. Pre tax instead of Post tax I think. In other news, there should be raises coming, if what I percieve is correct. Hopefully that's just a boon to me with another raise on top of that for a change in position.   Boring stuff..but it's my life.   Went out to take care of Erik tonight and he read a book to me. That was a wonderful thing to hear. :) I'm so proud of this little boy. He's working so hard at school and is struggling through the desire for independence and the need for his parents. At the tender age of 7 he's already been through so much. I hope to make his life a little easier in the years to come.
Just testing this thing out! Woohoo! I'm blogging.
Father's Day 2004. I haven't spoken to my father in 3.5 to 4 years now. My ex Step Father is recovering from a day out at the ballgame yesterday. My current Step Father is with my mom 4 hours away at a family reunion.  On Mother's Day, my mom was out of town. Easter, mom was with my Step Father's Family.   So, seems like it's a crappy set of holidays this year. ERik will be with his father on Christmas. So I'm sure I'll be here in St. Louis instead of with my family. I don't want to be around them any way.   Today is a bitter day. Ugh.   Blogging is entertaining, I guess. I'm going to start writing in here more. I'm going to write about specific things having to do with my family. Maybe this will be the catylist to begin the book I know is there.
