So due to the lack of a knife of proper size we were forced to cut a watermelon with a sword, doesn't that rule?  This brings to mind the concept of settling, who put such a premium on ambition?  I've oft heard people say to another you could do so much better or that if only they'd be great.  What's wrong with taking what comes, aiming low, contentment, station if you will, if happiness is the only premium.  How many find themselves empty after a lifetime of striving, all the time lost, all it takes is a few pauses.

Breath in the air, smell the flowers, cheers to the birds and put one foot in front of another and take whatever comes your way with a smile.

Silently it gleams, exuberant yet cool Melodic it beams, both witty and apt Composed it seems, the artiste even in jest Harmonius its' dreams, endowed with collection
So I had a sleepless night full of unsettling dreams.  Worst of which and as such I vaguely recall, was of witnessing a car accident.  In this: a woman is struck head on and is pinned within her car.  Unable to do anything I merely hold her hand and listen to her ramblings as death comes and claims her.  Not much of a dream analyst I'm left to carry a piece of despair with me on this day.  "Things I remember, things I forget.  I miss you,  I guess that I should.  3500 miles away, what you would you change if you could?" - Raining in Baltimore, Counting Crows
