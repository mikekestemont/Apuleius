It's amazing how individual songs and their respective covers can have such different meanings and evoke such a variety of feelings depending upon the artist, venue, and life context of the listener.  I hate to get all schlocky about this, but  urlLink Leonard Cohen 's " urlLink Hallelujah " is certainly one such song for me.  I must admit that the first version I heard was  urlLink Jeff Buckley 's haunting interpretation on his album "Grace." It was certainly the most beautiful song on that album and continues to be one of my favorites.  When I finally did hear Cohen's original, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it somehow did not spark the same emotional response. And though I love  urlLink Rufus Wainwright , his all-too-speedy, flippant cover of such an amazing tune was extremely ill-advised.  Having recently undergone a substantial move (from Minneapolis to Washington, D.C.), I was happy to spend my first Saturday night in the District listening to a friend of a friend play some respectable coffee house music at  urlLink Murky Coffee .  He was followed by a similarly respectable performer, who I was content to listen to while gazing out the window or talking with my friend and her brother.  Then - the performer, Sam Kim, muttered something about doing a "cover of a cover" and proceeded to knock me cold with a cover of Jeff Buckley's cover of Hallelujah. Welcome to D.C., Sarah.
So it appears the  urlLink Democratic presidential nominee is proposing an increase in the minimum wage .  It's about damn time, but is it enough?  Here in Minnesota, a Humphrey Institute professor and economist recently published a brief that makes " urlLink A Case for a Substantial Minimum Wage Hike for Minnesota ."  She and her colleagues note that the real value of the minimum wage in Minnesota has fallen from $8.27 to $5.15 over the years, and they also call for an increase to $7/hr.  [The authors also astutely note that those who claim a minimum wage increase will disproportionately affect the income of teenagers or other, apparently less worthy, single workers are making an argument that is remarkably akin to those made to "legitimize" paying women less than their husbands...]  Of course, people are also afraid of the negative economic consequences of such a "substantial" increase to the minimum wage.  While Card and Krueger have been forced to revise some of their conclusions, I do believe that  urlLink their research  offers some powerful evidence that, in the limited circumstances they analyzed, the minimum wage increase did not have a severe negative impact on the local economies in question.  While I'm still not sure of the adequacy of the $7 level, at least the minimum wage discussion appears to be starting again on the national stage.  Especially given the CEO salaries compiled by  urlLink xx  in today's posting, you would think companies could pony up a bit more.  Oh yeah. But I forgot that companies like Wal-Mart are spending all their money in order to engage in  urlLink sleazy tactics  like there's n
