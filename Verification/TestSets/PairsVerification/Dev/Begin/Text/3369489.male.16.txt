I've been lazy, which is why I haven't posted in a while.  Anyway today is Memorial Day and it's pretty ugly outside.  I've been working on my Blackjack final for programming.  I am almost done, I just have one more thing to do.  That one thing however, will be a bitch to do.  The Stanley Cup Finals are pretty interesting.  I am having a hard time watching, due to what happened in Game 7.  Calgary leads 2-1 though, Calgary really deserves the Cup.  They've played with basically an AHL defense, rookie goalie, and being the underdog in every round.  The Lakers should wrap up their NBA Western Final series, while Detroit and Indiana might go 7.  After the NBA and NHL Playoffs, it's all baseball until September.  That's it, I'm feeling sick, gotta go.
Figured I'd post this for fun:
Last night was one of the saddest moments in my life.  I watched the final seconds tick away from the Flyers season.  I'm upset that they couldn't pull it out, but looking at it, they got farther than they should have.  They beat the defending Cup champions, the Devils, and The Maple Leafs w/o some of their top defenseman and a rookie goalie.   They took Tampa to 7 games, while having to use basically 4 defenseman.  I'm proud to be a Flyers fan right now, and proud of what the team accomplished.  Hopefully their won't be a labor dispute and guys like Jeremy Roenick, Keith Primeau, Mark Recchi, John LeClair, and many others will be able to lift Lord Stanley's Cup.  Thank you Flyers for giving your fans a hell of a season.  This team will no longer be laughed at for wilting under pressure.  They will be respected for willing their way to Game 7 of the conference finals, while staring adversity in the face.  I don't think I'll be able to watch the Cup finals, knowing that my team came within one game.  This was a great season, and hopefully just a sign of what is to come in future years.
2 Hours till gametime and I'm on the edge of my seat.   Anyway, it's been a very quiet day.  I didn't get to go shoot pool this week, but next week will probably be good.  It's pretty hot here today, but....boy this entry sucks.  I may as well rant about something that irks me.  My target, people who think they're original because they follow a lifestyle hundreds of others follow.  You know who you are people.  Take goths for example.  I have nothing against them, in fact I know quite a few, and they are some of the nicest people ever.  The reasoning for some is really retarded though.  I live this way to be different.  When people say that, my bullshit detector goes off.  It's only different if nobody else does it.  Nobody is original in their lifestyle, because somebody else already did it.
Game 7 between Philly and Tampa is tonight.  I'm really nervous right now and there are still roughly 8 hours until game time.  I'm too anxious t
