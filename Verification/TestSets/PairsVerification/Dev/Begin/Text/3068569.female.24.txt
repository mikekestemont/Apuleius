Can I just say that the ads that blogger put on here as a result of my user name (smackover) are hilarious.  Arkansas biker bars?  Hah!  And Smackover tourism?  I don't think Smackover has tourists.
This is a brand-new day, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm switching to a blog way of life in hopes that the shorter format will appeal to my similar attention span and I'll, you know, actually update.  Now I won't be doing what's new with my life.  Frankly, not enough new stuff happens to make that even remotely interesting and everyone just hears about it anyway.  So I'll probably be using this space to complain, after all it's what I do best.  But first, stay tuned for a multi-post arc on why I like TV.  Cause you know I do.
If you too are concerned with how much power the FCC is being given in this preposterous post-Super Bowl era (not to mention being worried that this is all an election year ruse but that's not really the issue), then you should go to this website,  urlLink http://www.stopfcc.com .  There you can sign a petition or even send faxes to your US Senator.  Free speech is one of our most important ideals in this country and I don't think that any one person's ideas about "decency" should infringe upon that.  Hell, I think Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly are indecent and I still show people their books, albeit grudgingly.

Me:  sigh  "umm...nevermind."  I guess that wasn't so much a conversation as it was a monologue.  Or possibly a soliloquy.  What's the difference?
Well I have not been chosen to be on a jury of my peers.  That sound you hear is my peers emitting a collected sigh of relief.  It was my first time ever being called into jury duty.  I don't know how I managed to avoid that for 6 years, but I was grateful for it.  As much as I believe in the concept of trial by jury, that doesn't mean I want to be on one.  Plus considering how much I freak out about my own future, I really don't think I'm qualified to decide anyone else's.  So needless to say, I was a bit apprehensive about yesterday.  Like always when entering new situations, I was paranoid that the worst would happen.  I consulted everyone at work about what reading materials I should bring to best portray the "you don't want me on your jury" kind of vibe I was looking for.  Suggestions ran from hardcore right wing radical books by a Michael Savage or Ann Coulter (although honestly, I don't know if I could stomach even pretending to read those books) or one about psychosis.  I then decided something like  The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook  would be best because of it's interactiveness, it would show that it was something that I was genuinely battling with, not j
