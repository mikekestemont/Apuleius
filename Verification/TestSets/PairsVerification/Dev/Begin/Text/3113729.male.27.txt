I'm going to San Diego on Sunday and will be there for a week. There are a number of things I'm looking forward to doing, but I wanted to know if anybody else (that has been there) knows of any places or activities or whatever that I should *make sure* we don't miss while we're out there. I just don't want to forget anything. I already plan on going to the San Diego Zoo and In-and-Out Burger. Other suggestions?
I've been reading Walker Percy's  Love in the Ruins  for the past few wweeks now, and the further I get into it, the more I like it. After my conversation with you, Jeremiah, I made myself care less about the lapsometer's functionality and in doing so have started to appreciate the deeper facets of the story much more. I am thoroughly enjoying becoming fully immersed in Dr. Thomas More's growing paranoia and fleeting love affairs. I've got a chunk of time tonight by myself with nothing to do, so I'm planning on using that to get some more reading done. I thank you for giving me something to look forward to this evening.
Well, it seems as though Matt Pamer has died. As such, we fellas making a weekend out of Lebowski Fest is not looking good, which is not to say that I'm not still up for it. But if that continues to fail to materialize... Jeremiah, last night we talked of you coming to MI in June. The dates for that weekend we discussed are June 26 + 27 (Sat + Sun). If you'd like to make it a longer weekend, that'd be great, but I'd understand if you had to go back for work or school or whatever. Two days doesn't seem like enough time for us to catch up, though. Another bit of news that may entice you to visit that weekend... Pedro's playing at the Magic Stick in Detroit on the 27th (of June).
Guys, come on! Are you just being indecisive or what's going on? I've proposed a chance for all of us to hang out for a weekend, and nobody has made a peep about it. Are you forgetting that we haven't seen each other in almost TWO YEARS??? Let's go to Lebowski Fest and have a freaking good time!  I should've known better not to expect an RSVP for Lebowski 6.19, since I never even got one when you were IN my wedding...
I just thought I'd mention this... Blogger now has a comment feature. So when you respond to someone's post, just respond by making a comment instead of creating a whole new post. That will make everything on this blog nice and clean. When you click to leave a comment, you'll be asked to log in to your blogger account because I have it set so only members of this blog can leave comments. One other thing: if you have not yet, take a minute to create your Blogger profile. You can upload a picture and stuff. It's similar to a Friendster page, but no t
