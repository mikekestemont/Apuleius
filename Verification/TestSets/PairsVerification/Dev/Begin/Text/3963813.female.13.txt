So last night I had a dream that Travis asked me out. We were at Cameron's house setting off fireworks and Matt said you should ask out Cameron and I said I liked Travis so Matt yelled out to Travis that I liked him. Then Travis came over and asked me out and I said yes and he came inside and we ate cake. It was really weird.&nbsp; But maybe that means that I will get to go out with Travis. But I'm goin to the mall with Ej tomorrow. Me and her had a couple fights over the summer, but it seems like we're ok now. Alyssa seems to get a little madder everytime I talk to her. Well, she talks and whenever i say something she gets all pissed. Kd gets mad at me for sending her all these forwards. But I haven't talked to mj or d all summer. We all need to get together and have a sleepover before school starts. But me, ej and I think mj and kd are gonna be web leaders together. I'm happy cuz I think Devon might be a web leader, so I dont wanna be alone around him. If he says anything to me i'm gonna be like "screw you I met someone new over the summer". So yea, thats that
So I got my pictures of Travis.&nbsp; I really wanna go out with him.&nbsp; He's grounded so I can't see him, but I at least wanna see him one more time before I go home.&nbsp; I look at my pictures everyday.&nbsp; But it makes me wanna go out with him even more, and it really hurts that I can't have him.&nbsp; I mean, I haven't seen him in a week, and I'm so desperate to see him again.&nbsp; When I go back to school, I'm gonna hang his pictures in my locker, and keep a copy with me, like in my binder.&nbsp; I know when I go back to my mom's house I'll see Devon again, but it's not the same.&nbsp; I mean I think Devon is really hot, but I've never talked to him before.&nbsp; I really like Travis, and before he got grounded, I talked to him all the time.&nbsp; I love you Travis and I'll miss you!
So me and Cameron went to go ride bikes and we stopped over at Travis's house, and Travis said that he can't come out for the rest of the summer.&nbsp; So I won't be able to ask him out.&nbsp; At least I get my camera developed tomorrow, cuz I have all my pics of Travis on it.&nbsp; And Cameron still wants to fix me up with him.&nbsp; I wanna talk to him at least one more time before I leave.&nbsp; Nobody knows it, but I think I really love Travis.&nbsp; I know I really liked Shaun, but now since I met Travis, it feels like never before.&nbsp; I really care about Travis.&nbsp; The one day when we were alone in my backyard I was so happy, I felt like hugging h
