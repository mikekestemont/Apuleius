I picked up a book I borrowed from a friend around the Yom Kippur War. There is no doubt the hero of YKW is Ariel Sharon. However, one face stood out in the midst of all the pictures, a bald headed man wearing an eye patch. He is the legendary Isreali General, Moshe Dayan.   Moshe Dayan lost his left eye while in the British Army fighting in Lebannon. Since then, he wore what was to be his trademark, black eye patch. A tough and fiercely competitive and rugged nut to crack, he rose to become IDF's Chief of Defense Force. In 1956, He led the Israel's suez Campaign, defeating the joined forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan and invading the Sinai Pennisular.   Dayan is known to be the man who took the initiatives. He knew that the Arabs waged terrorism against them to buy time to build up their own forces. He wanted to force them into open battles and thus crippling the Arab forces. He regularly made raids into Gaza and inflicting huge casualities on the Arabs.   After he left the military, he served in the political arena of Israel. He served as Minister of Defense during the Six Days War. When the Syrians were shelling Israeli villages in Upper Galilee, Dayan was the one who made the decision to launch a full-scale attack against the Syrians. It was also Dayan who ended the fighting by arranging a cease-fire with Syria through Chief of Staff of the UN Observer Corps, General Odd Bull.   "Rocking the boat is his favourite tactic, not to overturn it, but to sway it sufficiently for the helmsman to lose his grip or for some of its unwanted passengers to fall overboard."
EURO 2004 will go down as the one that we saw the shattering of "myths" in European football scene. Truth had prevailed and come forth.   Myth #1 : Spain Spain was also considered a force to be reckoned with but Euro 2004 showed it is just another participating country. Such was the sorry state of Spanish football that they can't make it past the first round.  Myth #2 : England What do Erikson and loud hailers have in common? They amplify. England is just an average team with a few celebrity footballers. The only reason why England have such a huge following worldwide was because Britain or England colonised almost half of the known world during the glorious days of the Great Britain Empire. Imperialism and colonial brainwash. I'm sorry for all who still live in 1966, time to move on. It's 2004.  Myth #3 : Germany Let's face the fact. The "Golden Era" of German football had passed by. It's time for some restructuring and reconstruction. Will we see a "Third Reich" ?  Myth #4 : France Who says they are invincible? Talents alone does not subsitute hardwork and teamwork. Like I had always said, they peaked too fast and too soon.   Myth #5 : Italy I hate to say this but I have to say it. If Italy continue the way it i
