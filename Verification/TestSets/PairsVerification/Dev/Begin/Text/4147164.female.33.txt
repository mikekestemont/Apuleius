Subtitle:  My Alien Abduction    About a week ago, I coerced a stranger into giving me his Super Diamond concert tickets. Super Diamond, for the unenlightened, is a Neil Diamond cover band. Yes, you read that correctly—there is a real live band out there that covers Neil Diamond! Amazing.  I sent out a mass mailing offering up a ticket to the first person to respond and was deluged with responses. No, I’m fibbing—only ONE person e-mailed me saying they’d like to go. What’s wrong with the rest of you?!!!  At any rate, last night was the big night, and I was sooo excited! Or at least, I was—until I returned home from rowing and discovered that my ‘date’ had to cancel. I made several emergency phone calls trying to track down a friend. As luck would have it, I reached Andy, Mr. Spontaneity himself, and found someone eager to experience this cultural phenomenon.  The band was playing at Scene Pavilion, and when we arrived, it was standing room only. Again, I’m lying—it was the smallest concert I’ve ever attended. This turned out to be a good thing. We charged up front to the area I’m usually barred from, because I always purchase the cheapest tickets. We were within 10 feet of the band.  The sparkly Vegas-style outfits, the lyrics of Neil, the energy of the crowd, and the agreeable weather all made for a great time. Although I had expected to be one of the youngest people there, that was not the case at all. We found that except for a few bluehairs, we were in the same age group as the vast majority of attendees. Go figure.  Although the entire experience was fun, I think that the highlight for me was when Super Diamond walked off stage at the end of the concert. This is typically the point where the audience screams for 5 minutes to get the band back for an encore. Super Diamond was having none of it—they waited about 10 seconds, fearful that the audience would disappear—and came back for a rousing finish that ended with the classic, "Coming to America". What a blast!  Not ready for such a promising night to be over, we decided to head on over to Hoopple’s to see the Schwartz Brothers play. The band was—as always—fantastic, and the frontman was—per usual—his inflammatory self. At one uncomfortable juncture in the evening, he yelled at Andy for pointing at him and then made a comment about ‘the airhead sitting next to you’. ME. Harrumph. Thankfully, the spotlight didn’t last on us too long. We stayed another hour or so and then headed from home.  And here, my friends, is where things got very strange. I dropped Andy off, made a late-night run to Taco Bell, sat in bed eating nachos and watching a TV movie about Michael Jackson, and then went to sleep.  When I woke up, my upper body was wracked with pain. My toe was purple, swollen, and I believe, broken. These injuries appear to defy explanation. I can only conclude t
