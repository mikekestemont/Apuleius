Jane Doe- a few hints in response to your letter...   A healthy relationship between friends is the kind where if they get into fights, they always find a way to recover. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so, and it ended the worst way a friendship can. I saw many things that went wrong through a period of two or three years, but didn't point out because I knew you wouldn't see it yourself. So now that you're asking, I will try to point them out to you to the best I can to answer your questions. If you do not understand them now, try your best, and if you follow these hints, then some day you will see.   1. You didn't come to the possible source of the problem first. If you have a problem with someone or you hear someone has a problem with you, go to them first. Don't tell your friends, because somehow it will make it's way to them, and that will probably just make things worse. Telling others before you get the courage to talk to the original source will create a 'telephone.' I'm sure you've heard of it, it's where everytime the news makes it to someone new, the story changes and makes the problem(s) worse. And never have a friend talk to the person, you should do it yourself to prove to the person that it really does matter to you and you want it to get settled as soon as possible.   2. Don't ever assume that someone doesn't know or understand how hurt you may feel. It may very well be their fault that you're feeling so shitty, but maybe that was their intention.   3. I am who I am. I usually have good people skills so I can pick and choose my friends. If I don't like what happens with someone, I don't stick around... unless they're worth it. If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours... kick my ass my foot will be up yours. I stuck with you for two or three years, maybe more, so take it as a compliment.   4. I know i'm not the only person that's hurting in the world, I'm not that ignorant. Why else would I be involved in so much volunteer work? I'm also the youngest child in my family, it's natural for me to want attention.   Maybe "disgusted" wasn't the best word to use. Replace it with frustrated, or irritated.   I hope this last letter to you helped answer your questions. Use these tips, they will help in future relationships. I think about the way things used to be, too, when it was satisfying to both of us. Don't feel sorry anymore, what happened happened. It's time to just forget and move on.   Alli
Writing in my journal, I never really thought I would get feedback, nor did I want any. And while writing, I now realize that all these words will be read by you, so I'm afraid to say what I really feel... because I don't want you to w
