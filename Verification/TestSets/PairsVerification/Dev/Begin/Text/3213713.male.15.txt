well...... this is my first blog.... so i cant think of nething to say..... neways..... ill try blogging as much as i can....
Hey... here i am, blogging after quite a while.     Woke up at bout 11. Mom gave me the phone. It was my dentist. He asked me bout the Software. Damn, i had almost forgotten!! Kher, I made some excuse and told him that I'll work on the rest today. Then, I brushed and had some milk. Then, I sat at my pc. Chatted and posted at the forum. Then, I remembered that I had to burn some CDs. So, I located the songs. Converted them. Copied them to Dad's pc and burned the CDs. Then I listened to them and made the song lists. Then printed those lists. Neways, it was boring work.... and it took so long.  In the meantime, I also had lunch and watched the Pakistan vs Sri Lanka match for some time. I used to love cricket... but now, it seems as if i hate it!! I returned to my pc.... and finished those cds. Listened to a few songs. Chatted. Posted at the forum.   Then, I got Deejay's PM. She had gone for a week. And I ahd really missed her. I was happy that she was back. I replied to the message but it seemed that it didnt go. I tried almost a dozen times... but it timed out :@ . Then, I left for jogging. Hamza didnt come. I had done almost 2 rounds when I saw him on the track. He had come late, so i joined him. We took another round after that and then returned. Cooled down and went online. Chatted for a while. Forwarded some mails that had piled up in my inbox. Then, I checked Deejay's inbox. Emptied the junkox because all mails were bouncing!! Kher.... the junkbox was full of mails from the forum. And gues wat.... the msgs i had sent her.... all had gone!! :| It was like 12 msgs or sth. Kher... then i logged on to her forum account and deleted those extra msgs. Then, I continued chatting for a while and listened to songs.  After dinner, I went online again. Sana kept asking me bout the "Boys Forum"... hahahha. She begged me to let her in... but i couldnt :p. Kher... then Deejay came online. Man, were we happy to talk!! :D Her pc was not right so she was at somebody'd place. We talked. Then she went for some time and then came back. I was feeling sad already bcz now, i was going on saturday for a week :(. And, we couldnt even meet b4 that! :| Kher.... then she left bcz she had to go somewhere. I chatted for a while with Sana and Anum. I showed Sana the screendump of the forum.... she went crazy!! hahahahha. But, I couldnt let her in :p. Then, I had some mangoes.... and watched TV. Came back to my pc. Chatted some more. Haseeb Bhai came.... talked to him for a
