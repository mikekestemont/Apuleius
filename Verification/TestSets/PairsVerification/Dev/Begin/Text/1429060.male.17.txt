Good day, mortals. It seems that I have not been posting for quite a while for quite a good reason. Anybody watch the Memphis news? Or, even better, anybody in Memphis on Tuesday July 22? That's right. 100 mph straight line winds that snapped telephone poles like toothpicks and uprooted trees (the whole root systym) and knocked out the damn electricity for most of the city.  Fun galore. I am currently in Jackson, Mississippi, hiding from the boiling heat in the cool air conditioning of my granparents' home. Feel my power over nature.  I was flipping through this little poetry book I gave my granparents for a holiday and I am realizing how much the style I once adopted has changed. A sort of evolution, if you will. Somewhat weird.

Ever realize how far you've gotten since a point? I was experiencing such.  Cheers, humans.
Good evening, mortals. I feel regretful this evening. I posted a poem on the blog DOY in response to the prompt, but I felt bad about doing such, because it just....didn't.....flow. Alanna is angry-but-not-in-an-explosive-way at me for betraying the DOY code of never removing posts. Here is the dangerous poem that could strip your eyes of the retina if you read it too closely.    Unconsciously   Voice so tiny in the receiving end of a telephone Or b
