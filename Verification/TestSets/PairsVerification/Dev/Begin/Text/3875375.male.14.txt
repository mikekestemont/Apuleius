Sorry for lovin you the way that i do. Sorry for caring so much. Sorry for givin u my trust. Sorry for wantin u more then ever. Sorry for w anting to have you forever. Sorry for all i have done. And now i know that love isnt fun. You think u know how a person feels. Then you figure out your wrong. And it hurts a ton. Thats why i figuered out love isnt fun.
I sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you I wonder when I'll be able to look in your eyes To look deep inside you and see your soul The hours pass, then days and weeks go by Are your thoughts of me as fond as mine of you  I sit here in bed and smile with my thoughts of you Everyday my aspirations center on finding the one The beautiful love who brings out the best in me The girl who enlightens me with her existence I wonder if you might be the end to my search  I still sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you Has fate brought us together or kept us apart Because I'm sitting here writing these words for you to read I'm taking a chance that I feel I must take For two people in love is a goal worthy of kings  Maybe I'll lay here, sleep, and dream thoughts of you  -troy this is for a special someone

You never miss a good thing till it leaves you. I was heart broken when you left my world. man you dont know how much i miss you gurl. I need you now more then ever. I wish you could be mine forever. We used to break up and it was over just like that. Now its harder then ever to say goodbye  considering im closer to you now then ever before. Im sorry for hurting you. Your so amazing you suprise me all the time. Just promise me this isnt gunna be the last time your gunna be mine..   -troy
