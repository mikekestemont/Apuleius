God am I busy… there is so much I want to write about today too. Oh well, priorities. I need the time it would let me write one of my long boring posts to re-write my thesis proposal.
I just wanna live a normal life…  We had a good game of soccer yesterday. We played from 3:30 to 6:00 and by that time the sun was down and it was already too dark to play. When we first got there, we tried asking the local club if they wanted to play, but they were a club… clubs are meant to keep other people out not to organize and get people to join: is the context of this club.  It didn’t ruin our game though, we played with four of the local high-school kids. They were Ryan, Vladimir, Eman and Andrew… I think that was his name. Well we played four on four ground balls, I stopped playing mid way cause the pizza I ate was still making its way down to my lower intestines. Rico Arrives just in time to sub for me so I took the chance to relax and let it all go down.   Before my mom complained that I didn’t see my grandfather anymore… I audibly declared that, that statement was false and that I’ve missed a whole month already and grand-dad didn’t not only care whenever I was around but he was happier when my bitch of an older sister was there. With my one last remark I said “I love the old man- but he doesn’t even care.”  My dad should have reacted but I can sense that he agreed in his silence.  We watched the rundown…and it was a good movie experience. There was enough seats and we saw some other unexpected friends. Although I don’t know why some of the guys didn’t want to sit together. The reason I wanted to watch at that time and place cause I wanted to be together with them. It was kinda disheartening when I wanted to whisper a comment to certain friends, those I knew who would appreciate it were so far away. I’m sure people like the feeling when they laugh and find themselves outside the movie environment they can turn and look around to see his or her friends around or on one side.   Wala lang…  Anyway, I hoped to get a lot of things done for school today. 5 days to make all my requirements. I’m going half days this week to work on them. Without any internet access I can’t access mail and send mail to ask for other requirements and guidelines.   Right now I’m typing on my computer at work and saving it on a disk to download on the computer at home when I get out of my half day.   I feel kinda useless without internet in the my workstation… what the fuck do I show my boss that I’m researching the topics he needs when I don’t have any (again) internet… what Should I work at home… like they would a
