When one is stuck home, on the computer, on a Saturday night, whistling "Oh Canada" (I kid you not), speaking in the third person, one knows they should really be more active in trying to get a decent social life.   I know Holly wanted to go dancing tonight, but I didn't have the car (I had previously okayed my brother with using it and I couldn't very well take it back). Plus Holly would just want to go to Port'O'Call to dance and I really cannot stand the place. Though at least that place is not Club Axis. That place of full of people with IDs faker then Pamela Anderson's bustline. I am turning into a boring old fuddy duddy. I don't even feel like drinking tonight (though after the other night I am due for a rest).  Finally started reading up on Australian politics again after the Mark Latham shock win in the Labor leadership race. Though I am extremly amused at the Australian Democrats Leader having to step aside after abusing the Liberal Whip. The ADs are dead. I cannot be happier. Hopefully the Australian Greens will become the minor party with the balance of power in the Australian Senate by winning most of the AD's seats that are up for election next year. At least one knows where they stand with the Greens like it or lump it, and not get the constant run around the ADs are famous for.   I really need to start buying my Christmas presents. I do not want to be one of these people in a big rush and tizzy on Christmas Eve trying to find the perfect present.  Heh. I just remembered that Lennie was suppose to call me yesterday to see if I wanted to go to the movies with him. He must be mad that I blew him off the Friday before hand (but if he saw how much I drank the night before (Thanksgiving) he would understand). I'll call him tomorrow to arrange another time. Then again, it may of been a blessing in disguise. I know he wanted to see "The Last Samurai", a movie I have no interest in period.   Talking about movies I want to see, I downloaded the trailer to "Alien vs Predator" last night. The trailor was sub-standard and nothing special, but the small featurette by the director looked very interesting. While I have never been a fan of crossing over franchises, I have to admit, as a huge fan of the "Alien" series (I think "Alien 3" is grossly under-rated), I do get a spine-tingling shiver of anticipation with the movie. Plus from the featurette, the movie is going to fill in ALOT of the backstory to the mythos.   Buh Humbug. I am going to find my "Coldplay" CD. I need some decent music in my head. Or I can just dig up that live cover of Nancy Sinatra's "You Only Live Twice" which I hace somewhere on this computer...
