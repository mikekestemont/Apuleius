Well, I don't have too much to say. Me and Kris are going to hang out on Saturday so that should prove to be special. Also, my dad's cousin and her family are coming up to visit for about a week, so that should be cool. I haven't seen them in like 10 years. Me and Matt have been hanging out a lot, and me and Jen, since they live like right near me and I can bike or walk to their houses. Me and Matt went fishing yesterday and I caught a lot of seaweed. Oh, by the way Matt, I commented on your comment (finally) and I'm sorry it took so long. Well, nothing else to say, so byebye.
Oh my god this is stupid. My CD's are still not here. It has been a week and a half now, and still priority mail can't manage to get my a little box from Ohio to here.  I have barely talked to Kris lately, because she is always doing something when I'm not working (which is rare, since I am working Jen's hours also, while she is in Missouri) and the stupid payphone at camp doesn't work half of the time. I really want to see her. In any case, we still have the 31st coming up. There is NO way we are going to miss that because it is something we won't see again in a very long time. I guess I don't have much else to say, this has been a very boring few days. I'm going to go call Kris. Bye-bye.
The CD's that I ordered for my computer are STILL not here. That makes me very mad. I even paid extra to have them priority shipped. Not only that, I had $80 taken out of my last paycheck by the federal and state government for taxes, and they can't even bother to get some CD's from Ohio to here within a week. Ohio is only like 2 states away, and priority mail is supposed to come in like 2-3 days. But I'm sure they will come in tomorrow's mail, because I have to go to work at noon tomorrow, and therefore won't have any time to use them until 11pm when I get out...  I have to work at 4 today, so I really don't have that much time to do anything. Maybe I'll walk to the bank and deposit my paychecks that I have been collecting in my failure to make it to the bank. Oh yeah, I have to remember to deposit that check that is $80 SMALLER THANKS TO OUR LOVELY GOVERNMENT!  Sorry, I tend to get stuck on a topic when I am aggravated. I want to see Kris... I want to be held... :-( I feel lonely... Jen's on a plane on her way to Missouri, and I haven't seen Kris in like a week lol but it seems like forever... she was feeling really sick yesterday, I hope she's feeling better... Anyways, I guess I should probably go, I'm going to f
