Yeah! Stayed up to watch the first quater finals match between Portugal and England. Woah... it was definitely worth watching... Both teams showed determination to win and not giving up till time up and both also showed worldclass soccer...But in the end... Portugal wins. England took an early lead but after that, u could hardly see England going into Portugal's penalty box. h
