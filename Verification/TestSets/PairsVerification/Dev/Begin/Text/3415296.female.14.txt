I just finished writing a post and I'm writing another one. I feel so weird. I guess I just wanted to share everything. Before I go crazy. I just want to say, Nima you don't have to feel sorry. I would've done the same thing if I were you. Any friend would do that. Anyways I'm greatful that your my friend =), well best friend. I'm going to ignore the past and live on 'til my life ends. I remember all those times I would go to my basement, hold my cordless phone, and just cry. I really don't know why. I miss all those times when I would talk to him on the phone. I would always want to call. Like today, he didn't come to school, and what I usualy did was call him at school to see if he was alright. Now, I don't think I could do that. I can't do that. I still care about him. He just doesn't back. That's alright though. I just wish I was sure of one thing. If he really did love me. That's all I wish to know..
Okay I'm breathing in and out, and hopefully I'll get this right. I, Alice Lim, will talk to Safee about everything I ever wanted to say to him tomorrow. Even if it rains, I will not care because this is more important than getting wet by some rain. I will be strong. I will do what I say, even though I never do, I will. And for once I won't feel ashamed about what I am saying because what I will be saying is the truth, and I can't deny it. I just wish I had the confidence I needed.   Today I put everything that he gave me in this box. Even the stars I made, I still didn't finish making it all. I just thought that it can help me for a while. I was planning to hand it over to Nima, just for safekeeping, but then, I really wanted finish making those stars, really I did. I think I only have 100 left to go. But that's still 100. I remember yesturday I wrote [ 95 - 1053 ] on my name. 95 days, meant something. It was the number of days me and Safee was together. The numberof days where we were more than friends. 1053, the number of days I've known him since the beginning to the last day of grade 8. Some people say I should still give it to him, the stars I mean. I guess that's for what I feel about in the end.   I was talking to Nima on the phone and he said he was worried because he thought Joey sound upset over the phone. I didn't know what was happening, so I couldn't say I knew what he was going through. I just told him that whatever she's upset or thinking about, their love is going to conquer it all. I know that line seems tacky, but it's the truth. Their love i
