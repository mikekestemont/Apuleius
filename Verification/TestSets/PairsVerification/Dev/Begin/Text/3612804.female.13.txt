i seem to always be  crying for myself . i seem to  never cry for anyone else ... does that seem so  wrong?  maybe because all i ever do is think about  my self . cause my  whole world  is about  me . my  parents  are most of the time  on my back  and my  sister  is a  bitch . and im  tired  of being too  passive . i  cant  stand up for myself. when i do they  gang up  on me... like im the little  nerdy kid  at school and they are the  bullies  who pick on the  weak . maybe its because im the  baby  of the  family ? or maybe because now they dont have my  sister  to  rag  on cause she graduated.  life is a bitch and i will never forget that . i am always in my room  thinking ,  listening ,  hearing ,  healing , and  speaking  my  thoughts  my  dreams .  listening  to myself about these things just  calms me down . i guess cause i  am the only person   who understands me . and  i  know what people always  think  of me at  home  and  my whole family . being  ignored . even by my  grandparents  and  aunties  and  uncles . they  dont  ever  greet  me  first  second  or  third  im  always last . like when im  first  to come in at the door and they  see  me. and it seems like there  walking  torwards  me  and they just  turn  around and  greet  my  sister ,  mom , and  dad . then there is  me  i  have to  come up to them so they can  notice  me. its very  hard , even my  wrists hurts  and i didnt even  cut .also my  grandparents . they do the same to  me too . i  hate  it... people  always take me  for granted  then when i show them what i can actually do they  accept  me before even knowing ho i really am. i know that people think im  flaky, stupid, idiotic, dumb, lazy and fat, anything negative is all me . all here. the girl who'm everyone  blames  it on. cause im always  there . and today i was in so much  stress  it was pretty  noticable . but no one gave a  damn  i still had to  clean  my room,  clean  the table,  take out  the trash kinda, put  back  he trashbag,  feed  the dog,  wash  the dishes,  clean  up after kristine. and then i can  attentd  to my  own life .  tiring  and  boring  but something to do.   people always have to bring me down like what i said a again. this is the whoel thing i am going to say again but this is my whole day.   life's a bitch...  people always have to bring you down every fucking damn day. especially when your doing your best and being good. they complain and nag about how you do things wrong all the time...its like if you don t like whatever im doing why dont you do it for the rest o
