This poem was written in 15 frantic minutes one night.&nbsp; I woke up upset and restless and the words just came.&nbsp; I remember writing it...with a pen light in one hand and a bic in the other...on the back of sermon notes from church that Sunday.     &nbsp;   Tears on the Pillowcase   Loneliness creeps into my heart  Like a whispered voice from within the dark.  The superficial smiles have faded away:  The wounds of my heart are open to poetic decay.  Tears should arrive in haste  Laying my fragile heart to waste.  Lying in the sullen quiet  The world around becomes dull and silent.  Missed laughter escapes in choked out breaths-  The rhythmic sobs resound like memories long repressed.  After the storm settles inside my soul,  The torrent of fear is impossible to control.  The darkness prevents all rays of light  But in my heart, love continues to fight.    Emily Renee Burson, 2000
I wrote this poem during my Soph. year of college.&nbsp; I had been keeping a lot of myself (my struggles, my fears, my pain) inside.&nbsp; One night my friend Mike just basically forced me to tell him everything.&nbsp; It was the single most painful and impactful moment of that year and forever changed how I look at my life.     &nbsp;  Waiting...  In the darkness before the light I feel a warmth I'm too tired to fight. Between all the tears and smiles,  He has walked with me for many miles. The trials of life have taken hold Of the hidden passions of my soul. In the dreariness of the autumn's cold I still fight for ultimate control My God, I just don't understand; Why must life be so out of hand? Is the pain a path to happiness? Is my brokenness part of your plan? And I try my best to comprehend A love so much larger than my outstretched hands With patience I know he'll lead me to victory And show me my home in his glorious city. Until that time I'll continue to fight and lean on my Savior with all of my might. I don't want to make it all on my own; I will wait--my Father will lead me home.  Emily Renee Burson, 1999
This was the beginning of a story. I wrote it sitting with my feet splashing in the 'mighty' Jordan after a photo-journalism lab one Friday morning. Not sure where I was going with it, or if any of it will change, but thought it was worth putting here for anyone who happens upon this site to read...      Children of the Light and Dark  Sometimes it's the light that truly frightens. It's a lot easier to hide when you're in the dark. No one knows where you are. No one knows how to find you. You are left alone. That is what it means to be in the dark. But, when you come into the light, suddenly everyone can see you. You are no longer just a shadow of yourself, you are real and tangible. People know when you hurt and when you're h
