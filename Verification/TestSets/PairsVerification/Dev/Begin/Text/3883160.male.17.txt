Sorry I haven't been writing much. I was in Chicago (yea, I got to go to Chicago!) last weekend, and I wasn't able to post anything.   A lot  has happened on my reality television shows, especially Big Brother 5. So, let me fill you in on everything that's happened so far.  Big Brother 5:  On the Thursday, July 22, episode of BB5, Lori was evicted from the Big Brother house in a 7-2 vote! Lori took her eviction well, probably because she had already won $10,000 already. It was sad to see Lori go, because she is such a sweetheart. Lori admitted that she felt that Jase was dominating the game, and I couldn't agree more. So, why did Lori get the boot so early in the game? First off, Lori immediately put a target on her back when she accepted $10,000 on the primeire episode of BB5. Though it's impossible for me to blame her for taking the money, she should have realized that even though some of her houseguests urged her to take the money, there were also going to be those who didn't agree with Lori taking the money. Marvin is a good example of one of those who didn't like the fact that Lori took $10,000, which left everyone to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a whole week. So, when Marvin won the HoH challenge the next week, he immediately put her up, stating that Lori will get more money than both the first and second runner-up... which is probably true. After Lori's eviction, the Head of Household challenge was held. Drew ended up winning it, and Jase appeared to be more happy about Drew winning the HoH challenge than even Drew was! On the Saturday, July 24, episode, Drew put both Jennifer (aka Nakomis) and Holly up for eviction. Jase and Scott were not happy about the fact that Drew put up one of their allies (Holly) up for eviction, and they managed to make Drew feel bad about it. On the Tuesday, July 27, episode, we find out that Jase is a huge fan of Brad Pitt. Nakomis won the Power of Veto and she took herself off the nomination block! I was happy that Nakomis won the PoV, but I was mad to see Drew put Adria up for eviction. Remember, Adria has a identical twin sister named Natalie and if they make it to week #5 (next week!) without the other houseguests realizing two different individuals are playing Adria, they both get to come into the game and compete for the $500,000! I wish them all the luck in the world! That brings me to yesterday's episode. In a 7-1 vote, Holly was evicted from the Big Brother House. I'm assuming that Jase is the only person who voted to keep Holly in the house, while the rest of his alliance (Scott and Michael) and everyone else voted to evict Holly. After being evicted, Holly talked to Julie Chen and told her that Diane was jealous of her. In Diane's g
