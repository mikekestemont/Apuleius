Yes, thats right, sun-scorched. It would be a MAJOR understatement to say that i was just sun burned...the beach was fun thou. Yesterday was the first day of summer and i was awake at freaking 8 in the morning!!! Then we picked up Kaysi and headed to Galvestion for a fun day of "beaching" with the Mareks and Rollwitz. First we had to stop at Wal-Mart to get ice or something(i dont remember why we stoped) but while we were there i saw ALISSA who i hadnt seen in seriouly FOR-EVER!! It was exciting. but not as exciting as the car ride to Galvestion: Not only did we have a radio and our cd players, but we got to here live hunter playing "hot cross buns" on the recorder while harry sang to it. THE WHOLE ENTIRE WAY THERE THEY DID THAT!!!! OK..i can understand singing it maybe..but is the recorder really necessary!? or if your going to bring it, please learn other songs!! ah, yea..that was umm fun?! but then when we got to galvestion my mom made hunter leave the recorder in the car..which was DEFFINETLY a good thing! the beach was fun. i didnt get stung by any jellys, kaysi and natalie did thou. But what i didnt have in stings i more then made up in burns. Its Sucks!! hurts SOO BAD. My Face and sholders are blistering and red! WAYY ROUGH! The ride home was also very um...humerous?! I made the mistake of make the "Honk Your Horn" sign when we pasted this big truck..only he didnt honk! But then i had to explain to hunter and harry what i was doing..and of-course they had to do it to every single truck that went by. Only they did it wrong..instead of pulling down harry was shaking his fist at every truck! then i think he said the funniest thing in the world! ok so there was this regular pick up truck next to us FULL of mexican's, i seriouly dont know how they do that, very talented those mexicans. but yea so harry all making the fist and knocking on the window trying to get these guys to honk. so i was like harry, your only supposed to do it to big trucks that are carrying alot of things. and then he goes..it IS carrying alot of things!! its carrying 6 mexicans in the back!!!!! HAHAHA OMG! i seriouly thought i was going to die! Funniest thing EVER!! haha but yea, i'm really not feeling good bc i'm my burns so i'm out for now! i'll post laterr, bbyeee
ITS SUMMER!!! wow! i seriously dont think that the year could've gone by any faster!!! So many different things happened nad i cant even think back to when each thing happened bc it all just seems like a blur. I dont even feel pumped that its summer bc it doesnt feel like it yet. today was my last day of school and it was SO WEIRD bc no one was at school and i'm used to the l
