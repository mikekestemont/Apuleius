Today several branches of my family tree were grafted back onto the main trunk.  As my sister Becky & I walked across the  urlLink Wilson Chapel Cemetery  (she donated the new flags in the photo), she recounted little known, almost lost details from family members I vaguely remember ever knowing anything about:  my great-grandmother Cynthia Ann Pipes (b. July 3, 1891; d. January 18, 1945) who raised two children alone after her husband deserted her; my great-uncle Everett D. Pipes (b. March 22, 1910; d. November 18, 1935) who fell out a two-storey window and was placed in a mental institution until he undoubtedly died of brain damage.  I also learned of my grandfather's secret family in Dallas where he lived and worked for several years after the cotton fields were abandoned while my grandmother continued living on the farm in Peeltown with her own horde of children.  Then we moved on to Mount Olive Cemetery (which was in horrible shape) to visit our grandparents' graves as well as our Uncle Frank's, who was killed in Vietnam.  We finished our trek through this cemetery by visiting the graves of our great-grandparents Joe & Thirza Garrett.  Ah! more names and more information to run through my searches in hopes of finding more about my family.
Drank a couple of whiskey sours at the Inwood Lounge last night with Kris & Stephen as we raked several people over the coals of our discontent.  Later, had a beer with the Serb posse at Spike.  All that alcohol (as well as the heat & humidity & breakfast cheesecake) did me in as I tried to jog in the neighborhood late this morning.  I won't be doing that any more.  This day has been fairly uneventful, but tomorrow we're going out to Becky's; and together we're going to the cemetery in Scurry to decorate the family graves.  Very pleased with the new CD.  I'll call this week to schedule a time to get it mastered; and after I finish the design, it'll be available for purchase online.
When we were kids, everytime someone said "Wal-Mart," it was obligatory for the listener to say "Fall Apart" immediately afterwards.  It was one of those bizarre, linguistic games that only kids and Swedes can get away with.  (Someday I'll tell the tale of Morgan, the liguistical Swede....)  Now when I think about such games, it seems like an attempt to work some word magic, like when repeating a word with a "shm" prefix:  happy shmappy.  Love shmove.  Job shmob.  You are eroding the power of a word by SHMessing it up, SHMucking it up to where it no longer holds sway over your life.  After shopping at Wal-Mart last night with the great unwashed masses of South Dallas (of which I belong, at least geographically), I pray this meager magic eventually works:  Wal-Mart Fall Apart!
Thank god there's cheesecake in the house or I'd simply go berserk trying to re-decipher student loan applications & processes after so many years not having to think of such things (except, of course, remembering to d
