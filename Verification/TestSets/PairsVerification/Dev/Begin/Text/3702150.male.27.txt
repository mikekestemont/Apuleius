Today I met up with Angela, Jacob, and Michael to get together and discuss our plans for France. It was a good little jam session and we hit all of the good topics like sex lube, gender roles, and where to gat a good pizza.     Next thing on the agenda is moving the apartment over to a one bedroom with my bro. It is not going to be the funnest thing that I have ever done in my life, but in two months I am moving to France so I will live with it.     I am beginning to think about the first couple of weeks and having to get acclimated to the speaking and accents. I will be in the hotseat like the French students at UNCC were this past semester.    It is definitely crunch time now. I have been saying that I cannot wait until July to get here because that will mean that I am very close to leaving and now, BAM, here it is. I have no money at the moment since I am trying to play catch-up from school this past year and trying to get things situated while starting two new jobs has proved demanding.    Wow, that was depressing. On a much brighter note. My brother has decided to go work over at Dressler's with me. My other brother is moving into a larger apartment in Paris and has a spare bedroom that is free to use whenever I want to go to Paris!!! Go Fredy!!!    Well, it is getting very late and I have a lot to accomplish tomorrow.

It was a blast staying there for ten days and hitting the beach a thousand times. Miami is beautiful and I can see myself there one day. I might need to live a little to the North so I don't get gobbled into the late night seen. Just got done chatting with LucyJune about life and above all else our meeting with the other assistants on Tuesday. Gonna make a list and check it twice.   Went to the 2nd job and helped out the fellas. It is pretty good work. I felt like sipping some suds after in that machismo mentality. A good day's work deserves a little reward doesn't it. Not for long, I took my Jules for a walk afterwards and noticed the big, ripe, luscious blackberries hanging in the midst of briars. The briars resembling the impenetrable fortress of Troy. I threw then my Trojan horse and came back with a good 2.5 quarts of Helenesque berries. Damn, those babies are beautiful! Can you say blackberry pancakes? That's right. Some of that Wright's bacon, nice bit of maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream and butter, simply irresistible. If you are hungry come on o
