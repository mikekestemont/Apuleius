So I figured I would do a bit of research and find out what sort of prices people should expect for flights.  Here are my results:  - Vancouver to Castlegar, return, on  urlLink Air Canada  fluctuates between $299 and $320 CAD.  If you are going to book this flight, please keep in mind that there are only 3 flights per day. - Vancouver to Trail, return, on  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  is roughly $368 but this could change after Labour Day once they publish their new fall flight schedule. - London Gatwick to Vancouver, return, on  urlLink Canadian Affair  works out to 338 GBP.  I chose a UK departure of Oct 7 and return flight of Oct 14.  If you chose this option you'd also have to get the above flight from Vancouver.  Alternatively, you can fly from London Gatwick to Calgary for 337 GBP (Ooooooh) and then hook up with Camerak in Calgary.  You'd have to work out driving dates, etc with him though. - Charlotte, NC to Seattle, WA, return, on  urlLink Travelocity  works out to 238.70 USD.  You'd have to work out driving times with Lorax on this one.  If you chose to fly out of Raleigh instead it would go down to 232.90 USD.  Going to Spokane would be more expensive - i.e. from Raleigh it works out to be about 421 USD. - Atlanta to Seattle is 359.40 USD also on Travelocity.  If you flew to Spokane, WA instead it would be 381.90 USD.  Depending on your flights we could probably pick you up in Spokane as its only 2.5 hours from us. - Phoenix, AZ to Spokane, WA on Travelocity is about 193.40 USD. - San Francisco to Seattle is 153.20 USD roundtrip (Travelocity).  From there you'd have to hook up with Lorax to get here.  Alternatively, you could fly from San Francisco to Spokane which is more expensive at 253.40 USD but you cut the driving time to your final destination probably by more than half (as compared to Seattle).  And thats all I have right now.  If you want something priced out - let me know and I'll see what I can find.    P.S. Other people can post on here too if they want :P  Thats the point in signing up :P
