Here is the first chapter to a book that I've written.  If you would like to read the whole thing, send me an e-mail and I'll send you a pdf.  Also, you will probably be able to tell that it hasn't been edited.  If you would like to help me out and find me an editor, I will give you credit when I'm giving an interview on Hanity and Colmes for the book because it is a NY Times Bestseller!     A Right Wingers Guide to the Radical Left   By:  Jack Hattendorf (A radical right wing extremist that is part of the vast right wing conspiracy and evil right wing attack machine set to rule the world while keeping down all minorities, gays, lesbians, poor people, working Americas, unemployed Americans, illegal alien Americans and giving tax cuts to the rich so they can help me convert all the dumb Americans to my brand of snake handling Christianity and persecuting all that don’t agree with me while supporting companies like Halliburton and Enron or any other company that rapes the environment and takes advantage of the poor American worker by sending jobs over seas, darn it)   I.

Conclusion  Disclaimer:  I refer to leftists, liberals and Democrats with a very broad brush in the following text.  Please keep in mind, this is a generalization not specifically targeted at all leftists (just most of them).  I actually have some good friends that are as far left as you can get, and they actually do, gasp, like me.  Well at least they act like it.  We have lively debates and generally agree to disagree, so Mike don’t get mad at me I still love you but not in a gay manner!!!  Don’t worry, the above was not meant to be some sort of “Politically Correct” statement so liberal’s feelings won’t get hurt.  I just want to make sure you know that I refer to these groups in a variety of ways!  If they don’t want their feelings hurt, they need to put this book down right now and walk away!  I’m a bad ass, and I pull no punches!  I.  Introduction  A quick note before we get started with the first chapter.  My dad is going to retire this summer, and my mother is in the process of sending me many of my high school and before memories.
