Yay!!! I finally finished my new song!!! Well had a super tiring day and a super blessed dinner at Swensons just now wit family .. So when i was back at about 10+pm already was too exhausted to study and do anything else . Felt this obligation to just start something for the song , and trully it was all God's grace ... I took up this challenge from my youth guitarist to write a fast number instead of slow ones . Usually slow tunes just hum in my head all the time .... so they come and go easily though , but fast is a little teeny weeny more challenging to write . So yah , just started hitting my organ keys and some tunes came out , it blended , tried to get the key , kinda jazzy but "no , i'm not genius who knows how to write jazz songs!" . So it only sounds like one but not using jazz chords . Ok anyway , was too sleepy to think of any lyrics when i got the whole song done , but decided to flip the bible to Psalm 105 and there was it . God's word for the song and so extracted a little from there and the lyrics just poured out naturally and unusually .. i was actually playing the song with my eyes all closed coz was really reallly very sleepy (now can hardly keep them open too!). So the song now is complete , but t
