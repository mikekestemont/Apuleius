"Man is born free; and  everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and  still remains a greater slave than they."  Rousseau wins the prize for kick-ass intros. Any reader is grabbed by these claw-like words and pulled into the meat of the first book of the  Social Contract . This book is nearly laughably relevant to our modern times, especially considering the US's occupation-based empire abroad. I should say, it would be laughable if the consequences were not so grave. It's exactly the gravity that turns my stomach.   I mentioned my early inability to get beyond Rousseau the man. I'm still having difficulties, but I'm making progress. I can't exactly squash my feelings about the writer, but anyone who supported Clinton throughout the 90s is well-versed at separating a man's genius from his fatal flaws. I find myself incorporating them into my interpretation of the text, specifically regarding Rousseau's idealized vision of human history, in which our primitive selves were perfect and good until reason came along to screw it all up. An early problem with this romanticized view is that the primitives around Rousseau were indigenous, displaced individuals, and he's pretty condescending to consider them perfect without reason.   After Rousseau, and in no small part influenced by Rousseau, Charles Darwin wrote  The Origin of Species , in which he posited the theory of natural selection and suggested that all species were not created as separate, unique species, but resulted from adaptations from fewer species. Our scientific cannon has since grown to examine primates as human kind's species cousins, thereby positing that all primates share a common special ancestor. I think this is why my mind looks to primate activity rather than indigenous lifestyles when I read Rousseau today, even if that's not what he intended.   It's fascinating that Rousseau posited the first societies were signaled by the creation of families, as if before society was established, people (primates) lived alone. Among the four  urlLink great apes --the primates humans appear genetically and socially closest to--orangutans, gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees, we can observe today social patterns that Rousseau presumably envisioned as our utopian past. Only orangutans live alone, the others live in cultural groupings that include several family units, but are not defined by blood lines. Considering Rousseau's own relationship weaknesses, it's likely that he so idealized a life without familial obligations that his utopia necessitated that aspect.   Among the apes, chimpanzees are genetically and socially closest to humans. While all apes share at least 96% of our genetic make-up, chimps share over 98%.  urlLink Jane Goodall documented  through decades of study the amazing patterns of the chimp culture, and she's careful to never present this culture as utopian. Indeed, the chimps wage periodic and brutal warfare against neighboring chimp and baboon societies. But it is clear that the chimps have an advanced and organized society. Perhaps Rousseau intended some primordial existence without society, but since symbiosis, or mutually beneficial communal activities, is considered responsible for the leap from single celled organisms to multi-celled organisms a
