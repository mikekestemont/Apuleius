Seems the wonderful corporate artists at etoy has started an  urlLink etoy.DAY-CARE , it's goals are: etoy.DAY-CARE was established in 2001 to reach the following corporate goals: -to recruit and train outstanding individuals for long term etoy.OPERATIONS                                                          -to research identity issues, group behavior patterns and the creativity potential of children in digital environments                                                          to integrate children into the production of art instead of teaching them about art                                                          -to study future markets and to give etoy a competitive edge                                                          -to test and improve etoy.ART in a playful and innocent environment Why can't i be 10 again!  Seems very cool i'd totally forgottten about etoy.  Reminded me i've also lost track of  urlLink RTMark , i wonder how they are holding up.
A gentleman spends the better part of his life documenting his life, how much does it cost him to make the video $218 roughly, yet when he investigates the cost of the music that he wants to license in the video the price sky rockets to  urlLink $400,000 .  Though i must admit when i read stories like this i have to ask where did he get his camera and tape from?  Also how did he edit this masterpiece?  Last time i checked even a cheap Camera ran about $200 for an extremely low end.  You easily run into the $500 range without batting an eye. And tape even in bulk isn't cheap.  What ticks me off is the ratio, not the exact amounts.
For me i don't have as much free time as i would like to.  I don't have time to create like i used to.  I haven't yet purchased from  urlLink these guys , there price is sorta steep, starting at $299 for a set, or $99 for a clip.  Their samples look quite beautiful, especially as an alpha channel overlay would add character to just about any video i think.
What a better way to christen Media Wh0re.  Then to link to a mpeg of a  urlLink Tornado sucks up entire house .  Interesting side note is tapes and pictures of storms and tornadoes were what got me into media, both still and motion.
Just getting started.

Wish this was a higher quality and that you could actually see him get hit.  But i guess you live with what you get.  Still a decent video of  urlLink a sheriff getting Tasered  to show his support for the weapon
