Well, I started Weight Watchers on Wednesday. I have a great person (what are they called, teachers? leaders?, what?). She is the same one two of my friends have, both who have lost A LOT of weight. I am hoping they will be a wonderful influence on me. I am going to give it my all. I decided that I will stick with it come what may. I know there will be times I will gain a few ounces, maybe even pounds. Times when I stay the same for weeks at a time, but I am going to stick with it. Sure, it is 9.95 a week, but really, what is that, two lunches. Two lunches I should be bringing from home anyway. 5 gallons of gas, 4 gallons of milk, one package of diapers, I could go on and on.  So, I have begun counting. I have not done so much counting since 6th grade math. I am heading to the store shortly where I will take my little chart with me and pick some low points food. I want some good snacks around here for when I feel like I am not eating enough. Oh, I know I am not hungry, I have come to terms with that, but sometimes you know you just need something more, and more, and more, and more. YIKES!  Those flex points will be saved for Mexico, because I can tell you, I might rather go without eating to have a pina colada in la pina. The problem is I don't have just one, try four or five. Well, it is vacation. It is hot down there (okay not really) but it is vacation and I have FOUR KIDS! I need not say more.  So check back every Wednesday night, I will have an update after my meeting. I am hoping that having to post my losings and gains here just might help a little bit every time I choose something to eat.  Maybe, just maybe, the next time you see me, you will see less of me.
Still waiting on the "yes" or "no" for the property we bid on in Baja. We are heading down next weekend to take a look at something else just in case this one (which is our dream) doesn't work out for some reason. Anyone want to go with us?

Today we enrolled Siobhan in preschool. She will be starting the week I return to work. I am filled with mixed emotions. I am so happy because I know it is what she needs, friends to play with, learning with someone other then family, lots of different activities, and of course, snack time. But why does she have to be so big? She is two and a half now, and I wonder where the time has gone. Wasn't she just born? Didn't we have her first birthday only a f
