Heres a link to some lyrics I have recently written. I like writing. Review me please. It would be helpful. Thanks.   http://www.fictionpress.com/~benbowsher  There we go. Copyright and everything. Don't even bother trying to steal. Bastards. They will enforce copyright on ur ass. Criticism welcome. Don't be plain bitchy. I am trying to improve. Thankyou. I am an Art-eest you know.
Fat and egg like. Thats a saying. How's everyone? I'm Good. I've written a short story. Adam give me your email please. Thankyou. In advance. It is rather swell. ish. I have just finished listening to dashboard. Again. Some songs are good, On balance, Some smell like the bottom end of a skunk. The good ones are top notch. Download them. My my my. Thats a very good use of repitition. can't keep this up and stay funny. I apologise. It will gradually dissolve in funnyness. Like prozac in the bloodstream. Asparin in water. Urine on matresses and other such analogies. I apologise. The urine thing was not required. Unlucky is a key word here. A one word phrase if you will. A deep sea voyage of the english language. Exit.
Well i'd just like to whine for a little about how annoyed I am. This is not a good life. Whatever people say currently it's no conselation. I will regret sayig this soon.  I can't take this happy happy life thats going on when not everything is going well. I'm sick of saying yes i'll listen. I have stuff to deal with as well. This isn't directed to anyone by the way. don't feel hated. just needed to get it off my chest for everyone inn the entire planet to see. This is lame. I'm going to stop now. Back to normality.
Good evening again. It has been raining. The sun has been doing a short peep show. Now and again that is. I really am not on top form. Feeling particularly sad about leaving currently. No matter. I shall be back to normal. Soon. Descent. Beginning to wonder whether I have the right spelling of the right word. Is descent as in it's good or falling? No matter. Zoom out Camera man. Listening to "am I missing" by dashboard, it is mighty good. Buy their album also. I do believe that this is not a good choice. Moving. Bullshit. I don't want to leave you all. Ever. Just written a pretty awesome set of lyrics. I don't think I'll ever get to use them. I'm always second rate. Or it feels that way. Back to masking the way I really feel by short sporadic sentences. I would share my lyrics. but you'd jip them you thiefing munchkins you. Umpa-lumpas even. With your orange skin and your green hair. You make me sick.
Band Practice was cancelled. fun fun fun fun fun. This was not a good move. Jo and squeet practically became comatosed looking at one another. Nathan if you ever read this. Thanks. Daytime television does smell awfully. Until the day I die is on my record player currently. Page avenue b
