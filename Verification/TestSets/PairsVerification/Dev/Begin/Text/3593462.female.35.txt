Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.  I must know at least six women named Debbie.  In my life, certain names seem to re-emerge again and again;  Robert, Kathy, Tracy to name a few.  But Debbie, though the name constantly recurs in my life with new introductions, was one of a kind.  "Kids meet your new step-mom," my dad announced when I walked in from a hard day in 8th grade.  I was shocked to see him home on a weekday before 7 p.m.  But shock was soon replaced by amazement when my baby blues beheld the long brown haired twenty something woman straddling his lap in one of our two kitchen chairs.  Her jeans were tight and I noticed she wasn't wearing a bra under her tank top.  That particular fact really irked me because I had to beg my dad into buying me a bra a few days before.  All the girls were wearing them at school.  The boys were running their hands up our backs to see if they could snap them.  I was humiliated when one of the most popular boys in 8th grade, Bryant Heflin, tried to pop my bra only to find I wasn't wearing one.  The only thing worse than having your bra snapped by a popular boy, was everyone laughing when he announced you didn't wear one.  I made up a story about how bras slow you down when you run.  I was on the track team that year and didn't want to be slowed down by a bra.  But after much badgering I talked my dad into taking me to Rinks.  The bras were beside the fabric cutting station.  The lady cutting fabric figured out our dilemma when dad bellowed..."Just pick one!" He was uncomfortable.  Neither of us had any idea what size I wore or even how to find out my size.  The fabric cutting lady took out her measuring tape and put it around my rib cage and figured out what I needed.  Dad never shopped for bras with me again.  While I was taking in the newlyweds I couldn't help but notice the fresh smell in the air.  The asbestos tile was white and actually shining.  Our tan pleather sofa, the only piece of furniture in the living room, was now its sole occupant.  The large black amplifiers, speakers, guitar cases, and keyboard were gone.  There was clean laundry nicely folded sitting on the sofa.  And I smelled something cooking.  I knew all the changes were her doing, and I was pleased.  I rushed to my room after a quick hello to see if the changes encompassed the entire trailer.  The double bed was made and there weren't any clothes or trash on the floor beside the bed.  I quickly fell to my knees and looked under the bed.  The true test.  "I counted over 16 bags," came the female voice behind me.  "You and your brother must really like Doritos," she said again.  My dad was towering behind her when I turned around.  "I've never seen such a mess," he said.  "
