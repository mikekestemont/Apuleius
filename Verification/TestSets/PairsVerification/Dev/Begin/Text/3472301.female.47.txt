Some things will just drive you crazy.  They haven't a clue what causes Hodgkin's (although they do know it is a breakdown in the immune system, cause unknown), but there are some patterns about people who get it.  1) People from ages 15 to 30 and people over 50 get it most often.  I'm age 46, and we know I've had it for at least 4 years.  So I've had it since age 42.    2) People who have aids and people who have had mono (the kissing disease), get it alot.  I've never had either one of these.  3) Men get it more than women.    4) People who live in hygenic environments may get it more than others.  This certainly has never applied to me.  I mean like get a clue, I currently live with SEVEN dogs...:o)  5) Guesstimates are that only 3550 women in the USA will be diagnosed with Hodgkins in 2004.  1320 people will die of it this year too.  6) One of the highest Hodgkin's mortality rates in the country is in the Northeast quadrant of the state of New Mexico, where I have lived my whole life. This is an area with clean blue skies, fresh water, no pesticide usage (no farming), no factories.  Just rural, beautiful, and quiet.  Hmmmm..  7) For some reason in the last 5 years, more women in their 40's are being diagnosed with Hodgkin's, but again they haven't a clue as to why.  In the dog world, they now think that over-immunizing our pets may cause cancer.  I keep thinking about all those polio vaccines, etc. my age group got when were kids... Hmmmm....
All of those rumors you hear about this test being terribly painful ARE true.  First they give you a big shot of Demoral and another "happy" pill.  They do this because otherwise you would go home immediately once the pain starts.  With it, you are happy to make jokes with the staff and tell them how wonderful they are, even though you don't know them from Adam.  Next, they deaden your skin and muscles so you won't feel the huge needles going all the way to your bone.  The problem is there is no way for them to deaden the feeling in the bone when they siphon out the marrow along with a piece of your bone.    It takes 20 minutes and you can feel shooting pain unlike anything you have ever felt.  Without the happy pill and the Demoral there would be loud screams.  With it, your fingernails only leave permanent etchings in the exam table.
The tests were pretty impressive; I especially liked the brand new PetScan.  This test scans your body for live tumors.  They give you 2 injections - one is radiation and the second is glucose.  Cancer tumors apparently love glucose (sugar), so the glucose goes straight to the tumors.  The radiation attaches itself to the glucose and shows them up on the scan.  The scan only takes about 30 minutes and you lie still in a Star Trek type tunnel.   What's really c
