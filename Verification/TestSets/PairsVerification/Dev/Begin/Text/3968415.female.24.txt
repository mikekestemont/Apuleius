It is another 6-7 hrs before i set off to my first open water dive trip to Tioman.  I am totally excited !!&nbsp;   Then i received an email....  --------------------  Subject: EXXON MOBIL - BLOOD DONATION TODAY FROM 10 AM TO 4 PM  Hello all: The above service is at HarbourFront Atrium from 10 am to 4.00 pm today. Do birng your NRIC (Passport for non-Singaporeans) or Donation Card if you wish to donate blood. Regards, Judy  ---------------------  I used to be a pretty regular blood donor. NUS was just next to NUH blood centre. But since i started work 2 yrs ago, i think i have only donated blood once. Hence, my inital thoughts was "Let's go!!". &nbsp;  My chain of thoughts were if nitrogen narcosis was to happen,&nbsp; by giving blood,&nbsp; it would reduce the amount of nitrogen that can possibly be infused since there&nbsp;would be reduction of the amount of blood in my body,&nbsp;ya?  Nonetheless, i decided to ask the wise one --  urlLink www.google.com &nbsp;:o)   from  urlLink http://divermag.com/archives/april2000/divedoctor_apr00.html   Diving after Blood Donation By Dr. Sawatzky  How does donating blood affect diving?   For the first few hours/days after donating blood, the person will be more susceptible to fainting and will have a reduced exercise capacity. After the blood volume that was lost in the donation is replaced, the person will no longer be prone to fainting and might actually have a slightly improved exercise capacity. There are theoretical slight increases in the risk of oxygen toxicity and DeCompression Sickness but this change in risk most likely has no practical significance. You should never dive (nor do other strenuous activity) the day of a blood donation and should be sure to drink lots of nonalcoholic fluids after donating blood. It should be okay to do conservative dives the next day but if you want to be absolutely certain you have recovered from the acute effects of donating blood,  wait 72 hours.    &nbsp; The CONCLUSION  Think i will give this donation a miss.&nbsp; Afterall, I already have a buddy to look out for.    The last thing i need is to feel faint during my dive and to look out for him at the same time.    *hahahhah*  :o)
