That cursed 1.6 km run......ouch! My legs.....And I was stuck doing assessments!!! Then I just happened to fall asleep, and when I woke up I had a big headache and my body was radiating heat and through half-closed eyes I thought,  YES!! I have a fever!!! P-le-a-s-e let me have a fever, so i dont need to do assessments and I can stay in bed and I can attempt to play the comp! Pleeeaasee.......          But, I took my temp. and it was 37.1 C. It was my substitute thermometer, so I thought,  Bah, it ain't working, try the other thermometer, it WILL show that I have a fever!          I found my main thermometer and tried. Even worse. 36.7 C. I seriously thought about throwing it out of my flat. So in the end I still had to do assessments, and would you believe it, I finished 4 TEST PAPERS!!!!! All Science. And those cursed papers required me to draw the simple machines!!!! In total I drew:      2 gears (1 big, 1 small. The big one took me 15 mins 2 draw, mind you)    a Wheel and Axle    an Inclined Plane    a Pulley        Ugh, and my head still hurts. When I was getting out of the car, then I forgot my documents(the petition). I turned back to get it, then I hit my head on the car roof. Really hard. Then there was this loud THUNK sound, well, at least it was in my ears, anyway. And I was like,  Whoa, what happened? , I fell about....almost fell down!
One hour ago i was running the 1.6 km Run. It is soo......infuriating, stressing, tiring, and it puts you off yer nerve. I ran wif Aisha, since she came late. She walked it!!! We are  not  supposed to walk....but, I walked about 2 steps? Last year I didn't walk at all.      But that was bcuz I PRACTISED!!! And I was belted forward by Mrs Ng's words ringing in my head: " Sherrie you have alot of determination......Keep it up.......You can do it...." REALLY!!! She  really  said that to me last year!!!         For those of you wondering, I came in 30th place....Go on, laugh all you want!!!!! And the same feeling as last year, I couldn't feel my arms and legs when I ran into the coned area. I was like, is this a virtual game or something? Bcuz i cud see my arms and legs swinging but couldn't feel them!!!         Then I
