I'm bored out of my mind once again my plans failed and I'm sitting her disappointed I missed the movie I wanted to see because my mom wanted to plan games. Everyone in my house can take a peaceful nap but I take one and then people want to wake me up to do stupid crap. Its ridculous on the flip side last night I talked to my ex boyfriend I'm friends with his sister and me and him are still friends it was nice talkin to him catching each other up on each others lives. It was real nice. I told him of my fiancee and how wonderful he is and how much I love him and can't wait to be his wife. I'm really excited about all that. It was nice talking to someone I normally don't talk to but he's a real cool guy I think I'm going to keep in touch with him when i go to college that would be even better. So much as my fiancee and I what to say one minute we're on cloud nine the next we're at each other's throats but I'm going to try something new and see if it works. Hopefully it will. Lately it just seems like everyone i know is getting pregnant. I'm jealous but only a little because I know that I will have my day and until then I have some things that I have to accomplish before I start my family. Sometimes I wish that I could just start my family right now though. It would be nice. At the same time i want to be a little wiser and older I think I'll start having my kids around 22 after I gradaute college. But it's storming so i'm going to enjoy it................
Today was an ok day. I thought it was. The past week I've been going over his house in the morning his being my fiancee and waking him up so that he could go to work on time. Wed I had to go to work at 9 in the morning so I go there at like 6:50 and I put my pajamas back on and fell right back asleep in his arms I woke up looked at him and smiled. Thinking damn I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this man he's so beautiful. I don't know I think he's absolutely drop dead sexy. hehe you thought i was going to say sexy huh? But I think that he's amazing, then again I see him in a different light then most I"m the on that he complains and talks to as well as it should be. But Laying there with him was so fufilling and I get to do it for the rest of my life YAY. Spending this much time with him is absolutely heaven. I haven't really done too much else and thats fine with me. I can't wait to create all the memories with this guy. Hehe it's all good.
I'm still wondering why no one t
