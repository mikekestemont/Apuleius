reminder: i will not be contacting dandan in any way for   at least    a month-- meaning it can extend. 1.) i do not feel like it. 2.)i feel he's getting annoyed again. 3.)i'm paolo, i'm not   everyone else  , therefore, i cannot feel close to dandan again. 4.) bahala na sya. panira ng araw. 5.) nakaka pang-insulto.
July 28.  it's so sad.  dandan has left already.  it's really really sad... there were out-of-the-blue moments wherein i would just burst into tears. i couldn't help but be senti. i couldn't help but remember how we were as friends. 3 years. 3 short years. dammit. it really was too short. kung kelan nagka ayusan kami from our problems, saka pa sya aalis. haaay... i wanna cry again. i miss him. i miss dandan. i miss my best friend. i wasn't even able to concentrate last night. i had puffy eyes in the morning. ewan. i can't help but think how i failed him in more ways than one. yeah. i failed as a friend, all the more, i failed as a best friend, somehow. and now i can't even redeem myself, coz he's gone. you know what else sucks? i don't think he cares for me as much now. i read anjo's text-conversation with dandan, and it's really cool of them. i mean... basta. you don't wanna know. nakakainggit lang. i don't wanna be too obssessed about it... but, you know... i even called him up 10 minutes before his boarding. it was too awkward... moments of silence. i didn't know what to say. i just told him to take care, make us proud, that i love him so much. yet i didn't get any response. i dunno. i twas just too sad talaga.... napaiyak ako when i hung up the phone. kahit sa bahay pa lang nya, napapaiyak na ko. margie saw me shed a tear. dandan was crying in the car. it was all too surreal... he left. he left for the states already... haaaaay... i dunno. mixed emotions. basta i'll miss him talaga. i gave him so many gifts pa, just to remember me... yet i don't think he's gonna appreciate that. i wish i could be his best friend again. i really do. i blew many chances, but i'm still praying we can be best friends again. he posted his first message from the states in our yahoo groups. throughout the day, i just keep on thinking of how he is doing already. i wish i could message him again. ashley and i really miss him. panay miss him na lang. sorry. but i really do miss him.... i took him for granted. i put all the blame on myself... i don't want to blame him. i've never been right. i'm always wrong. when will i ever be right. ang sabog ko. un lang masasabi ko. im so sabog right now... i've got another long test coming up tomorrow. di pa ko nag-aaral. i miss seeing him online in YM. whenever i see his name in my phonebook, nalulungkot d
