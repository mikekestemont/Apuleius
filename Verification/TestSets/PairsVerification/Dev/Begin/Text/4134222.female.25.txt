Well it finally came... the day when I can finally write about what the major part of my life has been about. Darlene's surprise wedding shower was tonight at my place. For the last three weeks its been in the back of my mind with lists of things that needed to be done yet. Now don't get me wrong it was great but I'm glad to have it over so now I don't need to tell little fibs and worry that people won't show or have fun or be cranky with me. Here is a list of the things that I have learned: 1. Do it yourself (less stress) 2. Plan for people to eat more than they usually would 3. Women can chat for hours unless given direction 4. Even simple games can be quite amusing 5. Middle Age/Old people give the rudest gifts (sex kit, massage oil, sex game) 6. Your friends face when she walks in the door and sees everything is priceless and almost brings tears to your eyes  The shower went very well as far as I could tell. Darlene got TONS of great gifts and seemed to enjoy herself quite a bit and at the end of the day that's what counted. Well I'm going to try to get some sleep tonight since I didn't sleep at all last night.  xo
I haven't posted in the last couple of days because I haven't known what to write. I keep trying to get out all my thoughts then giving up saying "I'll do it later that doesn't sound interesting enough" but its comments like that which make me very upset down the line. For example this week my friend Austin has been scanning photos of him, his bride to be and their friends...there are tons of pictures of my other friend and Darlene and/or Austin but there is not a single one of me and them. When I realised that I felt so crap and immediatly thought... Am I a crap friend? Am I really not as close to them as I think? Anyways I got really depressed about the whole thing. Now I know in my head that just because there are more pictures of them and Sandra that doesn't mean that they are better friends with her but whatever it was I got really upset (actually still am). So then I was thinking back on all my years being friends with them going why didn't I take pictures with them then.... or that time...etc and I've come the the conclusion that I take my photographs in my mind. Perhaps in hindsight I should be taking pictures to share but I much rather enjoy the moment than say "Smile for the camera" or think Hey! this would be a great picture I should take a shot of this. I wonder if this is a problem for others as well as just me cause it seems like all my friends are into pictures. I'm kicking myself now though cause everyone at the wedding who doesn't know S
