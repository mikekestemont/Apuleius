PERFECT   Guys that I like  they make me twitch inside  it's always something about their smile or how they look at me or simply the way they dance across the room  to greet me  Guys that I have huge crush on they tend to  try ending my life by choking me  so that no words  can escape from my mouth by making my heart goes flying on a roller coaster jet or by taking  my breath away for no reason at all  And trouble only comes when I meet a guy like you  who fits perfectly into both categories  Depok, January 3, 2002 02:22 I always feel sad when I think of you these days   BI   I would never go bi because girls don't turn me on   But I know a guy who could   And the fact that he's a friend doesn't make me get it  Why would you want to be with someone who has everything that you have who feels the way you feel who thinks probably just like you who walks and talks like you and at the same time still like the opposite  They say the number is increasing  but I still don't get it  Depok, January 3, 2002 02:50   TECHNOLOGY   During the whole course  of trying to find anything that’s worthwhile I discovered  that whenever I’m in  for something huge always, I never fail consider it a record to make everything  turn into this chaotic pandemonium at the last minute  Is it my fault  if I want to yell  at something  that doesn’t even know its helplessness  Depok, January 8, 2002 11:35   MAGNET   the attentions  that he draws  are piling up in front of his door up through eternity  and both of us, the girls are looking at him  intensely not even trying  to regain our dignity  and he keeps on smiling and looking and standing there like he's just an average guy whose work is to make girls' insides melt like butter out in the sun  the question is,  who would he rather see you  or me?
