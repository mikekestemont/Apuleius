I'll never go to another football game again.  Too much stuff happens that I don't want.    That's all.  Have a great weekend!
Mine was cliche of a 16 year old's.  I went to school.  I finally got the set almost done for WCTV.  We're going to start filming tomorrow for Monday's broadcast.  I'm really scared that it won't pan out, I hope it does though.  I went to lunch.  I sit with a bunch of losers.  I'm not saying that I'm above them, 'cause there are 2 or 3 cool ones, but there are these 2 lazy eyed, game boy playing muthas that just make me feel bad.  One of them wears a bike chain around his wrist.    After school I went over to a friends house and listened to him play piano, he's good.  He can play a lot of different stuff that was written for guitar, like Matchbox 20's Unwell.  I think it would be cool to try him out in my band.  Oh yeah, I'm starting a band.  I set up my friends drumset in my practice area.  It's so small in there that you can barely move now, I like it though...except for the smell.  It kinda smells like must...but with wood thrown in the aroma.  Ahhh punk rock.  We're not a punk rock band though, we play more poppunk and emo than anything else.  I learned all of "You're So Last Summer" by  urlLink Taking Back Sunday .  I was so proud that I went inside and took a poop.  I'll let you guys know more about how the band is coming as we progress.  I'm hoping to have a demo made by the end of the year, a realistic goal in my opinion.  I've started like a million bands but I really hope that this one can be different.  I think me and Rick (the other front man) really want it.  Now we just need to find some guys who are also dedicated.  I have to get out of this town, state, region very soon.  I think I'll go insane if I have to stay here in Georgia for more than 2 months after college is out.    I hope you had an awesome day and remember to post on the message boards!
Yesterday I got hit on by one of the ugliest sad-saps on earth.  I just hanging out after school with a friend when this girl approaches me. I didn't care at first, I just thought she was going to strike up a casual conversation.  Wrong.  The first words out of her ugly ass mouth were "Hey baby, you got a girl?" I replied nicely, "No I don't really want a girlfriend right now." Then she proceeded to grab my ass. At this point I thought she might be mentally handicapped so I just laughed it off, but when she kept doing it, I got mad. So what I did was I decided to rape her.  The End.  I made that up.
Finally, I'm stressed!  I felt that I had been taking my life too easy b
