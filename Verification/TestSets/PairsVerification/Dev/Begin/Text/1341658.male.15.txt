So now once again, it looks as if the xbox 2(nextbox, xboxnext, whatever) will have a hdrive. Judging by these articles:     urlLink No hard drive.     urlLink Yes - hard drive         I think the new design looked cool too, but I'm sure that is just a prototype. {too cool for Microsoft}
So, today I decided that I wouldn't even try to make a crazyjoe.net website and instead divert all my energies into making a blog that was 10x better and 3x faster. Well, at least 5x cooler. I'll be getting some comments running in a little bit and everything will be fine.   I think.   I plan to do with this blog, what many others might have done had I been paying attention, but basically post about computers and technology and crap. Maybe life just a little bit of the time. But, lets not let life take control of you before you take control of it, right?   So to start off with my plan... (I should use less "dot, dot, dots" and more "dots") Google is introducing  urlLink G-mail . Should be interesting and I will definitely check it out because my hotmail account if 87% full 70% of the time and stuff google makes is cool anyways - 1GB. Who cares about a few text ads.

Why?-you may ask: Because my other profile was screwed up really bad and wouldn't display pdfs and windows media player. So now everything is fine again and I promise to make a log off all installations, errors, malicious code, viruses, and other bad things, all in one file called index.html. Yes, that's right, this file. Because i thought a plain word file on my desktop would be too boring. SOW....   Today I installed dBpowerAMP wma to mp3 converter. Because I needed to covert my previously converted files back to mp3 so that they can play on my new mp3 cd player.   Put a dash between crazy and joe? No of course not.  urlLink (homestarrunner.com)    So until the next thing...
