Sweet merciful crap. According to this bullshit quiz, I'm  The Fellowship of the Ring . Well, shit, if that's all applying to law school, 1L, 2L, 3L, the summers, and finding a job is going to be like...         You're  The Fellowship of the Ring !   by J.R.R. Tolkien     Facing great adversity, you have decided that your only choice is to unite with your friends and neighbors. You have been subject to a ton of squabbling and ultimately decided that someone humble is your best candidate for a dangerous mission. You're quite good with languages and convinced that not all who wander are lost. If you see anyone in black robes on horseback, just run. That's just common sense.

Well, I'm now halfway through my Cracking the LSAT book. I gotta say, I'm pretty proud of myself so far for actually buckling down and studying regularly. I've developed the somewhat bad habit of getting by without a lot of work throughout most of my academic career.  Yes, I was  that  student. You know the one. Never does the reading, always gets a good grade. Shows up late to the final, leaves before everybody else. I turned into such a slacker by the end of college--during my senior year, I actually went out of my way to see how little work I could do in a class and still get an A.

But this brings me back to my initial point--I've been working hard on this, and enjoying it. I love to complain about standardized tests, but I think deep down, I have sort of a crush on them. Maybe it's just some bizarre fascination with filling out bubbles or a special fondness for the #2 pencil, but I tend to enjoy the process of test taking. Does that make me some kind of deviant?  The games are getting easier already and it's only been 3 days of really working them. Admittedly, I think the examples in the Princeton Review book are somewhat easier than the real test. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out when I take the first of the real LSATs I ordered from lsac.org, which will probably be about a week and a half from now. If I can pull a 165, I'll be happy.  It's funny that when you announce you're going to law school, people suddenly come out of the woodwork with offers of information or advice of how to go about doing it.  My family had always been behind my career as an actor. I didn't come from one of those families whose parents are always urging them to be a doctor or a lawyer, where the thought of a child pursuing a career in the arts sends them into hysterics. No, my family was always very encouraging. Partly, I think, because so many others in my f
