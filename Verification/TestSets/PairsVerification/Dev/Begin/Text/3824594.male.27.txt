Thanksgiving is the perfect holiday for a charity invite. And a recently-divorced bachelor makes a perfect orphan. An uncle for the day. A friend of the family.  It’s the feel-good thing to do on a holiday free from awkward gift giving.  I was hesitant to accept my friend’s invitation to his in-law’s place.  Foremost, I drink too much for family people. I knew as much.  Yet my other options were too depressing. I knew I’d spend the day alone. In my condo. Carving a bottle of Wild Turkey. Enjoying side dishes of internet porn and college football.  It would be a dark day. I’d spend much of it thinking of the bachelor friend of mine who would be sitting in my place at the dinner table with my wife.  I was little more than a casual acquaintance of the family as a whole.  Months before, I was the minister at their daughter’s wedding.  My credentials were, intentionally, kept brief.  It was one of those things you don’t talk about at weddings. Like the bride’s ex-boyfriends or the groom’s past bout with a social disease.  Yet, I’m certain my credibility was called into question at the reception. A wedding is a celebration, I’d told the congregation in my brief homily.  And there were good reasons to celebrate. If only to avoid conflicting emotions. It’s a strange thing to preside over a wedding in the midst of your own bitter divorce.  So, I celebrated. I finished a bottle of wine during the photographs. And I kept good pace for the next bottle. This following the communal flask I’d emptied before the ceremony.  I was basking in the grace of the Almighty.  I recall a very unsuccessful conversation with the maid of honor. I was following her, slipping on a cord. A bustle was unintentionally groped.  Regaining balance, my face was slapped. Hard.  I winked at her date. I’m known for my charm.  The genetic father of the bride wanted to talk. I’d avoided him at the rehearsal.  Where was my church? What’s the name of the church? How long had I been out of seminary school? What was my religion?  Some questions are best left unanswered.  I’m sort of an Irish minister, I told him. Taking a swig straight from the bottle. It was close. Internet minister would have been more accurate.  Fortunately, the groom saw it coming. He was sweeping me off for the invocation. I didn’t know there was going to be a prayer. There was now, he said.  The power of my ministry amazed me. From the DJs podium I ordered them to bow their heads. And by God, they did. There was no preparation. I couldn’t fall back on the Catholic benediction I knew from my youth. It would be too revealing.  I had to wing it.  It was bad. I made some comment on union. It sounded very pre-coital to me.  I was backtracking. Successfully, I thought. The prayer closed abruptly. I was holding up a drink. The audience was confused.  In my religion, every prayer ends l
