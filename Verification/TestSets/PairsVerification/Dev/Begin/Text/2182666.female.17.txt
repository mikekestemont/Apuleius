urlLink        urlLink What kind of band geek are you?      ..big surprise :)  so today was such a good day!! im definately going to tape the channel 2 news thing because im on it like 20 times!! yay!!  im excited about tomorrow too.. at first i was freaking out because i had no idea what to wear for costume day and since we never have this spirit day i definately wanted to dress up. so melissa helped me find something to wear and we decided that i should go as Modonna. so i put on the costume when i got home and my dad just about fell out of his chair when he saw what i was wearing.. lol he said and i quote, "Jessica what are you supposed to be? a slut?" wow thank you dad!! lol so plans have changed..  saturday should be really fun.. my dad is having this company picnic thing. it's in the afternoon but they always have fun games and good food. then saturday night im going to spend the night over at melissa's and no parents will be home :) very exciting!!  alright well i need to study for a chem test.. that class is killing me and im pretty sure it's because o'lenick cant teach for anything.. ohh well  bye guys!! see you tomorrow at the pep ralley!!
what started out as a bad day turned out pretty good.. ok so im having way too much trouble in chem considering how much i like the class. it's just so frustrating when im making horrible grades and people around me are making 100s. ugh i will never understand that.. anyways everything else went pretty well. my sister had a concert at first colony tonight which went pretty well. everyone sounded pretty good and i got to see the incoming freshman for next year.  i know im going to sound like such a little kid by saying this but i miss my mom so much. i guess i've never realized how much i depend and care about her until she's away.. it just sucks that i have to find out this way.  so im having a really hard time deciding what to be for halloween.. if you have any ideas dont be afraid to let me know :)  i am so excited we are down to 1-2 rehersals a week. you have no idea how much this makes my life..  k well im going to bed bye guys goodnight and i'll see most of you in the morning!!  jess
well i just want to start my first blog by saying hey to everyone!! but a special thanks goes out to all my friends at church.. our youth pastor who im sure you've heard me talk about might leave our church and move to san antonio. it really sucks because not only is he probly one of the best things to happen to our church, but this is the third time someone has left. i know God has a reaosn he is doing this, but it's really hard f
