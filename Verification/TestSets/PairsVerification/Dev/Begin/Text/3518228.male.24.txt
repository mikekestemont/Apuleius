Why must it be so annoying to do anything useful under windows?  I spent more time than I care to consider just trying to get  urlLink RCS  and  urlLink EMACS  to play nice under Windows 2000.  I'd blame the GNU software, but I've been able to get it to run flawlessly under Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.  With Win2k, the only way I could get anything useful to happen was to install the  urlLink cygwin  tools. Does it really count as installing under windows if you need to throw in a Linux emulation layer?
I saw the movie Memento tonight.  Very good movie.  Complicated.  If you watch it, be prepared to watch it several times.  Salon.com did a very good review/analysis, which you can  read  if you're curious.  (Update 12 Jan 2003: The review seems to have evaporated, and I haven't been able to find another link for it.  So it goes.)  There are a few questions that still remain for me.  In the scene in Natalie's living room, where Leonard flashes to a syringe of insulin, how much insulin is in that syringe?  To my eye, it looks like a whole lot. Even after pausing and zooming, there aren't any numbers visible.  This makes me wonder.  There are a number of scenes where Leonard's memory  works when it probably shouldn't have. For example, when Natalie is trying to rip the picture of Dodd, Leonard tells her that she needs to burn it.  How would he remember that tearing wouldn't work?  I think that Leonard's condition is real, but not because he can't make new memories.  There are things that he doesn't want to remember.  So he forgets.  Some things slip through, though.  The story of Sammy Jankis would seem to be Leonard's story.  But since he cannot &quot;remember&quot; it, as it happened after the incident, he projects it onto someone else.  Mrs. Jankis would get Sammy to hide food around the house, and then stop feeding him to see if hunger would cause him to remember where things were hidden.  Maybe Sammy/Leonard's memory slipped (or in this case, didn't slip) about some of that spousal abuse.  So I ask again, how much insulin was in the syringe that Leonard remembered?  Did Leonard kill his wife in the way that he relates it in the story about Sammy?  Or was it more purposeful?
It seems like everyone and their little sister has a weblog.  Ok, my little sister doesn't but you get the idea.  I'm starting to wonder if maybe it might be fun/entertaining for me to keep one.  It's tempting to do so, just because I can. However there are some privacy issues with weblogs that I'm not sure I like.  You can't exactly control who reads your weblog.  It's tempting and comfy to start just expressing whatever opinions you might have as if this were a little personal journal.  But it's not personal.  It's very public. Well, I'll just do my best to control myself, and we shall see how this goes.  I saw  Pirates of the Caribbean  y
