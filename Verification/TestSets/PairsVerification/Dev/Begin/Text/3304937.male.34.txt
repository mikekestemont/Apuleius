Every day there are news reports about more Americans being killed.  Why are we still there?  We took the land by force, but the occupation causes us nothing but trouble.  Why are we still there?  Their government is unstable, and there is no leadership.  Why are we still there?  Many of the people are uncivilized. There are more than 1,000 religious sects and almost as many languages and dialects.  Why are we still there?  We can't secure the borders.  Why are we still there?  They are billions of dollars in debt and it will cost billions more to rebuild, which we can't afford.  Why are we still there?  It has become clear....... We MUST abandon California.   I got this in an email from my grandparents and aunt & uncle. Usually I don't like these kinds of emails... and I'm not sure what kind of commentary this provides to the Iraq war... but it did take me by surprise and made me laugh.
Has it really been a week since I made a post. Wacky.  Local radio is finally picking up on one of Little Rock's better bands now that they're on a big time record label. The Kicks' "Mir" is getting airplay only five years after it was recorded. 'Bout time.  Here's to The Kicks! May their hits be many.
I am the king of morons.   It was sprinkling when I left for work this morning. So I turned on the wipers. Which meant turning on the headlights. Halfway there, the rain stopped, so I turned off the wipers. Guess what I left on? Guess what else I forgot to turn off when I got to work. So, now, I have a very dead battery in my car. No problem. There are plenty of kind co-workers willing to give me a jump. Why, I even have my own jumper cables in the trunk.  Amiable co-worker and I hook up the car and she starts up her motor. I get out of my car to make some idle chit chat while the battery soaks up life-giving electricity. And closed the door with the lock down and the keys inside.  Clearly, I am the stupidest man alive.  I also can't remember if I turned down the roadside assistance plan available through my cell phone carrier, or if they never really told me about it... but, now that I've signed up, it won't take effect for three more days (though the first two months are free!), so I'm still out $30 to get the lock popped. And then get the car jumped again. Hopefully all will be fine once I get back into my car and get it started. But it's put a severe kink in my day and my self-esteem.  Needless to say, I'll be getting another spare key made (the one I had fell out of my wallet) and I'll probably buy one of those jumper dealies that will let you start the alternator and charge the battery through the cigarette lighter. Of course, then, I'll probably remember to turn off the lights w
