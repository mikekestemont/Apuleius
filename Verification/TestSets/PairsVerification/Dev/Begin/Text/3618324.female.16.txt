Ones born of heart and darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all worlds and bring desolation.  Sieze all hearts and consummate the great heart. All hearts to be one, one heart to encompass all.  Realize the destiny: the realm of Kingdom hearts. The great darkness sealed within the great heart.  Progeny of darkness, come back to the eternal darkness.  For the heart of light shall unseal the path, seven hearts, on keyhole, one key to the door.   The door of darkness, tied by two keys. The door of darkness to seal the light.   None shall pass but shadows, returning to the darkness.  One born of the heart and darkness, hunger for every heart untill the dark door opens.      im bored so i typed this sucker up from kingdom hearts.  me:
