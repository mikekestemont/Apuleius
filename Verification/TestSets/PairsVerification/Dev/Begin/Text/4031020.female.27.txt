Maybe not. Either way, I'm very glad that I finally put it out in the open (at least to myself, since I think I'm the only one reading this blog), and I can see with my own eyes that I must make a lot of changes if I'm going to lose a ton of weight in the next 5 months.  Tomorrow is the start of a new month. Don't you just love fresh beginnings? I think God gave us new beginnings for a reason. New minutes start every 60 seconds, new hours every 60 minutes, new days every 24 hours, new weeks every 7 days, new months every 30 days or so, and a new year every 12 months. That was no mistake.

I don't hate thin people. I also don't admire them. I truly think people are just people, and everyone has their quirks. I have to admit though, that sometimes I wish my "quirk" wasn't so damn visible. I mean, you've got your anorexics, your alcoholics, your nymphomaniacs, your drug addicts and your fattys. For the most part, these people can pretty much hide their problems and either work them through personally or literally kill themselves over it.  Except the fattys.  No, we have to not only eat ourselves miserably into oblivion, but the whole damn world knows it. And then the world makes fun of us for it. Even Paris Hilton would have to admit that sucks. Except she doesn't know what it feels like so she could probably care less. Hell, I could care less about her problems, so who can blame her?  I walk around every day advertising that I have a problem. So what do I go and do? I s
