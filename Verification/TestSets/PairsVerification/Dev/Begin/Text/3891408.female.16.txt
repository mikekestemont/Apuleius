Lately i have been having the time of my life...but yesterday def. wasnt one of those days. Like everything was going wrong...and now some people hate me for it.&nbsp; I wish things werent like this but they are and you just have to find a way of dealing with it or you will be misserable. So yesterday we were suppose to have another craZy asS nite....but we found out it was cancelled at the last minute...literally as we are getting in the car to leave. The we went to KJs bc we had no where else to go.Then we were gunna go to Michelles for a bondfire n everything...but as soon as Biney,Ben and Mike got there...we left for Codys. Well that was a bust so we just ended up hangin out at fast food places and driving around. Michelles was fun though..we havent done that in a long time girls...i miss all of us hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as the night went on things got worse..and now i feel like&nbsp;shit...as a person. I hurt some people in the process of having fun...even though it really shouldnt make that much difference to me anymore...somehow it still does. &nbsp;And i know it may seem like im ok and i dont really care i do...but sometimes it just hurts too much to just sit down and think about it. Because the more i think about it...the worse i feel and then i start to regret doing what i did. But i know in the long run i did what was right...and i will be ok...and so will they. I just wish life wasnt so complicated all the time. Like i wish you could do whatever you wanted and no one would ever get hurt or anything. But in reality no matter what you do...whether it hurts you or not..you may be hurting someone else in the process. Sometimes i wish i could see what life would be like without me...like what my friends and everyone would be like. Would they all still be friends...would they be as close. You dont know the impact youve made on other people...and i wish we could see what life would be like without me..just to know...and to see if i really did make a difference in someones life. Idk anymore...i just wish life made sense again.&nbsp;
