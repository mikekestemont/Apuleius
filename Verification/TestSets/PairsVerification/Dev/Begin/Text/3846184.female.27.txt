I can barely keep my eyes open (written while trying NOT to read into the extreme fatigue I've been experiencing as a pg symptom...) but I just had to write a little before I hit the hay, especially since I feel like my earlier entry sounded like a bit of a downer...but as I referenced there, like New England weather, if you don't like my mood, just wait a few minutes and it's certain to change!  At any rate, at my grandmother's birthday party today, I held my 3-month old nephew (my first, born two weeks before my first edd) and I didn't feel sad or broken!! I loved holding him and told my brother that I was going to take him home. I was so happy to hold him close, and I didn't want to let him go. It felt so good, since the last time I saw him I couldn't hold him because it just hurt too much...  I am rambling (I do that even more when I'm tired) but just wanted to document an "up" moment. Maybe, just maybe, my heart is beginning to heal...now if I can just get to the day when I hold my own little one, I think my heart will heal, someday.   Patience and faith, patience and faith...
I saw this saying on a bumper sticker the other day (oddly enough, on the office door at my step-daughter's day camp) and I just felt like, oh boy can I relate!!!!

Hmm, maybe it's a combination of all of these factors. What do you think?  I have been so tired lately, and of course that adds to the ttc obsession, and it hasn't helped me to feel very productive lately. Everything seems to take an effort, and when I don't do everything I want to, the guilt sets in (I'll save that for my next entry...)  I just need more time in the day, that's what I'm always saying...and now I have to run since we're off to my grandmother's 89th birthday party. Yup, 89. Can you believe that?  More later...  p.s. Many thanks to my girl Janet for reading and commenting. I need and want to comment on your recent entries, but just haven't had a chance. Always thinking of ya, though...
Yup, I'm surely in a funk. I think there are a number of reasons as to why, and of course I'm sure that the anxiety and fears of trying to conceive (especially after two miscarriages) are a part of it. Being a full-time step mom suddenly for the summer (now 4 weeks into 8, when my  PRE-TEEN  step-daughter has never been here more than 10 days before) definitely plays big part as well, but all in all that's going well. (If we can just eliminate the p
