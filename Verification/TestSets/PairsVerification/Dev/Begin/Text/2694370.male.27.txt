Well, we pick up actually in the middle of October, and this is just a quick summary of what happened the last two weeks.    10/23/03    We spent some time reviewing and making the list of what had happened in the group since April 2003.  We had a quick discussion from Matt. 10:27 about laying our lives down for Christ.  As we do this and delight ourselves in Him, He will give us the desires of our hearts... His desire for the lost.  We then began to pray over the map of our city.  As we were praying, the Lord gave an interpretation of tongues that were spoken.   "There is a power in the heavens... it is very great.  There is a power in the heavens... Who will stand against it?"   We believe that this is refering to the principalities in our area of the world.  Two of them locally being Fear (Superior) and Unbelief (Duluth).  We also believe that God has put angels at the gates of this city, and that through prayer and fasting God is going to turn this city around.    10/30/03    We began this night by discussing from 1 Corinthians 14.  The theme seemed to be that when God speaks, we need to listen.  Don't just put it aside and forget.  We also discussed the relevancy of the gospel today.

After some time in prayer, we believe that God was speaking:   "If you do it, it will happen!" & "If you go I will do it"   This was a specific word of healing for Laurel B.  We also felt that God wanted us to be bold and step out.  No more timidity!  So, we packed up and headed out to Laurel's house.  On our way, we stopped to speak with some teen guys on the street corner.  One in particular God was calling!  It was so clear.  We spent a long time praying for Laurel, and it was clear that He is not done with her or us yet!
F.I.R.E. started in April of 2003 as a group born out of the desire of individuals from Living Stones Fellowship to have a unique outlet for evangelism.     The idea...   The idea behind the group that makes it unique, at least for our church, is that it's goal is to be totally Spirit lead in it's structure from week to week.  Nothing is really set from meeting to meeting other than the place an time we meet. (...and sometimes that even changes!) It is a time to step out of the box of traditions and the way things have always been done, with only God's presence and His Word as our guide.   Normally?   We usually take time to discuss anything that may be on our hearts for the evening, then we begin to pray and sing songs of worship.  We spend time in God's presence and wait on Him with open hearts. The attitude of the group is that if we need to stay there a
