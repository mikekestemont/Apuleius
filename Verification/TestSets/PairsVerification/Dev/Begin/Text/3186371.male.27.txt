By JEREMY RABKIN WSJ July 13, 2004; Page A14  Maj. Michael Newton, a military lawyer who teaches at West Point, coined a new term earlier this year -- "lawfare." It is the pursuit of strategic aims, the traditional domain of warfare, through aggressive legal maneuvers. Last Friday's decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), holding Israel's security fence in violation of international law, is another milestone in the onward march of "lawfare." The ICJ has now confirmed that "lawfare" and warfare can be pursued simultaneously.  The terror war against Israel, launched in the summer of 2000, has by now resulted in the deaths of nearly a thousand Israeli civilians. The security fence, by greatly impeding the movement of would-be terrorists into Israel, has helped to achieve a sharp decline in terror attacks over the past year. Nonetheless, the ICJ admonished that the nations of the world are obligated, not to pressure Palestinians to abandon terrorism, but to pressure Israel to dismantle its security fence.  Most of the Court's reasoning, based on arguments advanced by British barristers, is superficially plausible -- so long as one ignores the actual political context of the dispute. Perhaps the Children's Rights Convention or the Fourth Geneva Convention do provide arguments against disrupting the free movement of innocent Palestinians. But the arguments are more plausible if one ignores the terror threat to Israeli lives, as the Court essentially does. In concluding that the fence sits on "occupied territory," the Court assumes that the armistice lines of 1949 are Israel's final borders, though never accepted as such by Israel's neighbors. In concluding that Israel cannot undertake intrusive measures to protect "illegal settlements," the Court assumes that Jews had no claim to return to places, like the Old City of Jerusalem, from which they were forcibly expelled by Arab armies in 1949.  Who now has what rights in what territory is at the heart of the dispute. Stripped of its technicalities, the case here was Palestine v. Israel. And Israel lost by 14-1.  The statute of the ICJ provides that the Court may only decide disputes submitted by states and then only with the consent of the states that are parties to the dispute. This provision follows the practice of the international court established under the League of Nations, of the international arbitration court established by the Hague Peace Conference in 1899, and of all previous international arbitrations. Serious diplomats have always doubted that international questions, involving the highest national interests, could be settled by mere legal reasoning.  The traditional approach to international arbitration would have barred the Court from entering into this most intractable international conflict. Palestine, since it is not a recognized state, cannot sue before the ICJ in its own name. And since Israel assuredly did not consent to let the legality of the fence be decided by the ICJ.  The U.N. General Assembly, however, at the prompting of Arab states asked the Court last December to provide an "advisory opinion" on the dispute over the fence. The U.N. Charter allows for this procedure, b
