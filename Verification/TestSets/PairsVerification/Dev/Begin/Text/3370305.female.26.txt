I found the greatest site today on Weblog Review, urlLink Ktraveldan Network.  A great writer and funny as hell to boot!
Did you ever notice that some people just emit a slimey vibe? After talking with some people, or in rarer cases, simply seeing some people, there's a greasy film laying heavy in your mind.      I have an Uncle like that, whom I had the unwanted, unasked for displeasure of talking to this weekend. Break out the stereotype meters...he happens to be a used car salesman. Shocked you, didn't it? Yeah, he's the one all of the jokes were written about.       He once tried to sell his own mother a mini van that had been welded together down the middle, and had coathangers holding vital components together underneath. It didn't seem to matter that she could be killed, or that she was never in a vehicle with less than 6 grandchildren (his included) and was more often than not on the busy highway. Nope, none of that mattered, what mattered was the easy sell he had before him.     I don't know why I bring that up exactly, other than the fact that the slick oily feeling is still with me after talking to him. It's just that I had the television on the news channel and politicians were talking nonchalantly about terrible problems  from their two dimensional world, and I had a quick redip in the greasy pool. I turned it and found myself looking at a commercial for FOX's 'show' The Swan and was practically drowning in the feeling, only this time it came with a smell...like rotten cabbage atop a garbage filled dumpster on a hot humid day.
I noticed while searching other blogs, that the one nasty little thing that plagues the masses, is lack of comments. Some brave bloggers throw convention to the wind and flat out beg for it, some coyly hint they'd like some, and some silently fume behind their computer screens vowing revenge and swearing that people don't know a good thing when they see it.  It's kind of like sex, I suppose. The computer has made us all wee little comment whores.        I'm wondering, how many bloggers go into their shrinks and bring up their lack of comments or hits? Can't you picture it, them laying on the sofa (do shrinks really use those, btw?) telling the doc how no one loved them as children, no one respects them at work, and there's no one to go home to at night; so they got an online journal to make a connection with some soul out there, even if it is on a computer, and they don't appear to want them there either. When that first popped into my head, I thought it was a funny joke, ha ha, but now that I've really thought about it, I bet there are people who do that and it's not so funny anymore.     Do you think lack of response is the reason for the countless 'ghost sites' out there? You know the kind I'm talking about? The f
