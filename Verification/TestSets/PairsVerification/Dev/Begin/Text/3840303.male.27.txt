My little laptop has decided it doesn't like me, and has stopped working.  After a complicated phonecall with Dixon's customer service youth training scum (sample dialogue: "Hi, my laptop has stopped working." "What's wrong with it?" "It... doesn't work." "Oh, right.  Why's that, then?"), I arranged for the lovely people of DHL (or was it DHSS?) to come and pick it up.  So, they posted me a little brown box a day or two before collection, and I packed it away nicely.  Delivery day came, and now my laptop has been taken to wherebouts unknown by a burly man with a fake-looking moustache called Kevin (the man, not his moustache... I don't think it had a name and, if it did, I was too busy keeping an eye on the scary owner).  Problem is, I have no idea when it is coming back... various calls to Dixon's have resulted in the conclusion that it may turn up sometime this year.  Helpful fellows, customer service people.  I MISS MY LAPTOP!  Well, I miss being able to scour the net for obscure things at 2am. Right now, I am relying on the internet cafe (and the lovely ladies that run it) next door to work for my web fix. Thankfully, due to some expert flirting on my part, said internet cafe ladies don't charge me for my time online. I hope they don't want some free books...
Bored.  It's my day off work today, and here is a run-down of what I have done.  Woke up at 11:30am (after finally falling asleep at 5am). Went to bathroom, and answered the call of nature. Put TV on, realised that I'd have to watch "This Morning" or some other lame-ass morning magazine show, and wept silently. Turned TV off. Bumbled about the flat, avoiding eye-contact with my washing up. Text some people; got no response (except an invite to go feed the ducks, which I declined due to the effort on my part that would have involved). Went online. Went offline, utterley bored. Looked at my Dvd collection. Went back to bed. Got up. Got dressed, and went to Tesco. Bought things that I don't need and that are bad for me anyway- to wit, a chocolate fudge cake and a "meat" pie.&nbsp; I don't know what "meat" it is, but it has 20% less fat.&nbsp; Less fat than what, I don't actually know since it didn't specify. Went home. Went online.  So, here I am. Still bored.  I need&nbsp; a hobby.&nbsp; Maybe I'll take up archery. I think I'd be a good twanger. "TWANG!"   I wonder what this "meat" is?
Every so often, my limbs seem really heavy.  I can be at work, and it feels as if my legs and arms have weights hanging from them.  I never do any physical activity to warrant this, so I can only put it down to one of three things:  1) I am dying &nbsp; 2) My diet is so poor that it affects my health and stamina and, therefore, makes me feel drained all the time &
