i feel like crying.  and i can't form any thoughts as to why. perhaps its being lonely, but it's not as if i want to talk really. but i do. it's incredibly fustrating to be struggling with yourself on whether or not you want to do something. it's as if i'm a hammock tied upsidedown between two trees. the wind keeps blowing, yet i haven't managed to swing myself upright. back and forth. back and forth. (but not quite as calm, perhaps a hammock in a tornado.)        i really dislike the song "the reason" by hoobastank, albeit i'm listening to it right now. (reject internet radio only allows you 5 skips, and sadly i've used them all.) the logical choice would be to change stations, only that takes far to much effort than i'm willing to set forth. although i informed launch to "never play again." --that's great, i'm feeling all non-happy and "my immortal" starts playing. where's my 50 cd? or linkin park, that would work too...drowning pool would also suffice, or even johnny cash's not slow songs.       school commences for me on friday. i'm not sure if i want to return anymore. i'd like to curl up by myself. no, that's bad. i'll go. frankly, i'm scared to be breaking out of high school, and going to (part time) real college. wsu is fairly "real" and i hope i can survive being a little kid in a big kid world. when i was five i used to see middle schooler's as cool and it's happening again only on an older scale. i think it's ageism in society.       i ought to watch reservoir dogs. mr. pink makes me laugh. or perhaps the 1962 manchurian candidate. raymond shaw makes funny jokes. (yes, the groucho marx thing is quite humourous.) in any event who's "modest mouse"? (launch has serious defecit's in music).
i'm not the typical "ettya" at this moment: but i haven't expirenced this emotion- it's alien. it's as if i'm being yanked between extremes of how i want to mold me, how others want me to be molded (although expectations are low) and how i want to be molded for others. i've been fighting internally, and i feel as if the conflict is beginning to ferment in my overt actions. therefore, before i take up an action which may hurt another, i wish to appologize. or perhaps, i haven't changed nor am i seeking to. there are few who care to listen and few whom i care to tell.    also, i feel lost as to a certain other matter of decreasing significance. simply, i regret blabbering a few secrets of mine to another. and i need to talk to a specific third party, although i have an irking notion that i'm being held around the base.    i miss several people in kansas, although many would misinterpret the notion of "several" and immediatley pair that word with those whom they believe i ought to. no, i'm not angry, upset or driven in any respective manner, i'm simply ambivalent. it's rather amusing- t
