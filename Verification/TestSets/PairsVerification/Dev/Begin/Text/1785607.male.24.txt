OK... went out yesterday to celebrate the end of the first week of school... a group of friends and I went out and grabbed a bite... finally we went to this place to have some "drinks" and some wanted to dance...  As night passed I realized that I'm in this place alone, though all my friends were alone and that I was getting attention  (in the total sweet and innocent sense of the word)  from a girl-friend. It just seems that when I'm in a group the sense of loneliness gets so much hard to endure. That and my big secrets!  So it all comes to the moment that I just can't handle all this pressure... I'll explode but it scares me... the reaction, the sense of lost that I'll be having  (because it will happen)   I just wish it all could be a little easier and have a friend approaching me and telling me: "I know" ... It'll lift all the woes and worries... and I could be a lot free... 'cause as I once heard:  "the soul suffers"  .... You have no idea how that is true...!!!
Feel so blue again... Well, for what is worth, I went out yesterday, but just realized how lonely I am...     The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top The snow is softly fallin' The air is still within the silence of my room I hear your voice softly callin'  If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon the page The words of love you sent me  If I could know within my heart That you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are liftin' The mornin' light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are driftin' if I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love And to be once again with with you To be once again with with you.    Song for a Winter's Night.     Sarah McLachlan
Now I'm so tired.. but tired good..!!! ... Back at school and having no time to even sit... and again lovin' it  But why you'd ask... well... is so simple it's stupid:  "Hate to have all that free time to think in what could have and didn't"  ... and that's what I love about being so damn busy with school...   Last wensday was my mum's birthday... I didn't buy her anything, have the money though... but don't get mad at me, she knows I have the money for her present and that I'll take her later next week to spend it... we both are busy.. so...
I've been getting mails pointing t
