I know not this person standing before me,  Yet She bears an uncanny resemblance  She stares at me with a questioning gaze I wonder what she knows And does She wonder what I know?  Would you be so kind to trade places? I queried My shoes have grown too tight,  Maybe you can fill them? But our feet are exactly the same size She replied showing me a dainty foot.  Desperate, I pleaded You are me and I am you Nobody will be able to tell the difference She smiles sadly, Since you are me and i am you what I feel is what you feel What I do is what you do  Perhaps you can make better sense of  Life than me, I pressed For I know not what I do You have done good, she smiled For I would have only done the same
There was once when i would run from bad things, shut out people who care, spend days under the covers of my bed and gribe about never being able to change anything and complained about how life was always unfair to me.   My latest neurotic habit has been to run to another country to escape. Now i find it ironic that i just want to run home and hide under my covers again.   So maybe my love affair with HK (and other love affairs included) has finally ended, and the only logical thing to do would be to fall back into old bad habits, escape this place, go home and be miserable.  But i'm not going to do that.   I've learnt it the hard way just how much we all are resistant to change. And for a long time now i've been practising the art of change. And yes, it is an art bacause humans are creatures of habit(especially men). Once we get into comfortable routine, emotions or actions we cling to them cus it becomes clockwork and requires little effort to put into motion(see just how aptly men fit into this profile?). Change is a crucial part of sustaining hope, cus when we keep moving, doing something new, our senses are constantly heightened to the experience of new things, and we learn a little more about ourselves along the way and hopefully, move one step closer to 'finding ourselves'.   The way i see it, i have two options.   I can go home, settle for a normal job, spend my paycheck shopping every month, go back to complaining about life in Singapore not being enough again.   Or i can take on a challenge, accept the job offer in China, start a new life in a place where i will more or less be totally alone, grab life by the balls and see where it takes me.   I'm gonna stare change in its face, and make it cower to me.
I know how the story ends now...  girl gave it her all, finally made a committment of her feelings and told him how she felt.   He had beforehand already said how he felt that he truely wanted t
