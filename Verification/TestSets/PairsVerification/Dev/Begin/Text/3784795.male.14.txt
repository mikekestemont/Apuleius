I will be leaving on Wednesday (the thirtieth) for a series of vacations that may lead me to absence until July eighteenth. Here is how it pans out:   On Wednesday I will leave with my dad and best friend,  urlLink Cullen , to Alpine Lake, California. My mom and sister will already be there. We will camp until Saturday the third.   Then, on the fourth, I will leave for my lacrosse camp in Santa Barbara. That is four days, from the fifth to the eighth. I will return home either on the eighth or the ninth.   Then, on the tenth, I will leave with that same friend and his family for a strange mystical place called Mather, where supposedly fun will abound.   I will return the seventeenth or eighteenth. Don't miss me too much. When I return I will begin on that quest to make a good design for this. Maybe I can get somebody to design me a logo and/or template at deviant urlLink ART
Well, $ urlLink jark  has his  yellow [ alien ] probed  blog, so here's mine. Here are my plans:   Hopefully I can buy  urlLink bacon.com  soon, and this can be all mine. I will have an art feature, for all of my deviant urlLink ART , as well as an album for my "scraps" and such pictures that are not art per se. And of course I will have a blog. I hope I can somehow persuade my parents to let my buy a website (yikes), or at least keep it on reserve until I am old enough to buy it myself. Before then, I will attempt making templates again, if I remember any HTML, or maybe just commission somebody to make it for me.   I started to get uncomfortable with my  urlLink old blog , since all of my friends knew about it. It was hard to post on it and feel secure. I slowly stopped using it, because it took too much energy. Perhaps that will happen with this site too. But, I'd like to seem more professional than I really am.   I enter the world of blogger.
Character 1  [ Question :  What is his name? ] is the true definition of a party animal. He is still 22 but out of college, living out of an apartment in Santa Barbara, where he had graduated from UCSB. He still keeps up with the college party life, and he chills every day with his college friends and frat brothers. This is the life he dreamed about: college with all the party, none of the classes, and all of the women.   He works at In-N-Out by day, but by night (and by lunchbreak) he hits the beach and hits the clubs. Every spare second he devotes to swimming and playing volleyball, Frisbee, football, and such sports at the beach; partying at all the clubs; drinking and shooting pool at all the bars, or at his friends house (the only friend of his that had a true "house") to practice with his band, Eargasm. He is s
