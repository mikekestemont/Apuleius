I won't be on  urlLink IRC  or  urlLink AIM  or any chat stuff much lately. I need to get away from my cyber palz™ for a little while. You can  urlLink e-mail  me or call me and I'll be happy to talk.   things i plan on doing while im not chating... [in no kind of order] -get a steady job. -work with Mike on the songs we've written so far. -save money. -finish filling out the financial aid stuff. -finish  urlLink dmbirc.org  so that I can pass it off to someone who can update it regularly. -work on artwork. -find out who I am.    I talked to my boss, Rob at  urlLink Saratoga Web  and he said he's got a lot of work for me to do now so hopefully this will turn into something steady.  I'm excited about that and it couldn't have happened at a better time.
