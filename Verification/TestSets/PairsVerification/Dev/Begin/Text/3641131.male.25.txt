So there was a huge subway-workers strike in London today. People are having a bitch of a time getting to work. Didn't affect me, though. I've been walking to and from work ever since I moved to my new flat, only 30 minutes from the office. Anyway, walking to work today was surreal. The streets were just packed with people. It was kind of cool. I think I'll attempt to work out a walking commute to any job I ever have in a city. It's so much better than the subway. Not only does it cost a fortune to get a subway pass over here, but it's so fucking hot (in your suit, don't forget) and crowded during rush hour... Walking for 30 minutes to work is about a thousand times better than riding the tube for 5. (Although in fairness, unlike New York subways, the 'tube' here is relatively clean, spacious, well-lit, and there aren't many rats running around. Plus they have a digital sign that tells you  exactly how many minutes until the next train arrives  imagine that.. so you don't have to play the typical NYC subway game...  well...we've been waiting this long... this we should just cut our losses and leave?  Anyway, that just adds to my theory that London resembles Boston more than it does New York)  Also - I read that people that walk only half an hour a day cut their rates of heart disease by huge amounts. I'm so healthy!  When I first came out here to London, I was shocked at just how expensive the food was. I mean, NYC is pricey, but there's tons of great food to be had on the cheap. So my cheapness and laziness meant that I ate way too much fast food and junk food the first couple weeks I was here. Plus, the British absolutely love chocolate bars and all things Cadbury. They even have fucking candy bar vending machines in the fucking subway - so that didn't help.  But I've turned over a new leaf. I'm eating well. First of all, as a vacation student intern at the firm, all my meals at the firm's cafeteria are free! And it's damn good. As I've said before, lawyers at prestigious firms are very picky about their dining, and the shit here is fancy. They always have fancy meats and fish dishes, soups of the day, and a daily vegetarian option! So I had that today; in lieu of the Roast Chicken with Sage and Onion Stuffing I had the Baked Potato with Humous, Avocado and Sprouts, and it was damn good. Tasted a lot better than you would think, and I felt so healthy for eating like a vegetarian. I really wanted to try the other option though, Red Onion &amp; Goats cheese Tart Tatin! And I had my daily glass of fresh-squeezed OJ to go with it, of course.  Since my meals here are free, the temptation of course is to over-do it. I come early every day so I can get breakfast, a
