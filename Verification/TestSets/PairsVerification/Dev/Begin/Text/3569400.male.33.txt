I hadn't realized the movie would make me cry.  I hadn't anticipated how heartbroken and angry I would feel as I walked out into the street - also scared, angry, sad, agog at the evil being done in the name of America.   I'm going to do everything I can to help John Kerry get elected.  I don't believe that John Kerry is a golden-hearted honest man, but I'm sure that he won't take us to war for no reason.  I'm sure he's not a treasonous ideologue.  The neocons have led us onto a path of constant war.  It's going to take a generation to backtrack, and that's if we start today.   urlLink www.johnkerry.com   urlLink www.keeverforcongress.com   urlLink www.moveon.org   There's plenty more.  Do something.  Today is the last day to donate to candidates in this quarter.  Every House Seat in the country will be on the November ballot along with 1/3 of the Senate seats.  What are you going to do?
The  urlLink NYT reports  on the Democratic National Convention - "But what is close to certain now, they said, is that Mr. Clinton will speak in prime time on the convention's opening night, July 26; Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts will speak in prime time on July 27; Senator John Kerry's running mate, who has yet to be named, will speak on July 28; and Mr. Kerry will give his acceptance speech on July 29."

And speaking of personality, the  urlLink NYT reports  "A day after not getting the Green Party's endorsement for president, Ralph Nader brushed off the rejection as an inconvenience, described the party as "strange," called the party's national nominating convention "a cabal" and predicted who the big loser in its decision not to endorse him would be." This may be Dem hatchet job on this goggle-eyed wunderkind, but it's clear that his impact in this race will be a lot less than was initially expected.  Without the Greens, it will be hard for him to get onto most ballots.  Meanwhile, back in Iraq, the fledgling government made up entirely of American appointees tries to figure out how sovereignty could feel so powerless.  Bremer  urlLink leaves his footprint  on the 51st state,  "BAGHDAD, June 26 -- U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer has issued a raft of edicts revising Iraq's legal code and has appointed at least two dozen Iraqis to government jobs with multi-year terms in an attempt to promote his concepts of governance long after the planned handover of political authority on Wednesday."  Please remember, too, that all CPA contracts must, by  urlLink U.N.law , be upheld by the new sovereign Iraqi pseudogovernment.   urlLink TomDispatch writes  about the pseudostate, asserting, "Iraq reenters the world with its sovereignty weighed down and constrained by 97 L. Paul Bremer-inspired occupation administration "legal orders" that, for years to come, are meant to control practically all Iraqi acts from who can take part in e
