Well, I've only written one thing so far for this blog - the title for my first post - and already I've come upon a question: who do I address in this stupid thing?  Obviously, a good way to start is not "dear journal", that was just a joke, and probably not a funny one.  But who?  People who might be reading this?  I'd assume that this will only be read by a few close friends, but the last time that I assumed that, my website was viewed by the entire school and created a huge web of controversy.  So I think that you'll agree that I have justification for my unsure attitude!  Anyway, I just started writing what I hope will turn into a book.  I'm not ready to share any details yet, but as I get them ironed out, I'll be sure to share them, as well as some pieces of what I've written.  I guess that's the main reason for me creating this blog.  But from time to time I'll use it for other stuff, too, so keep an eye out.  Also, check out the political magazine blog that I share with Matt - ontoponline.blogspot.com.  Thanks for visiting!  Corey
Welcome to the online magazine "ON TOP of the world", which stands for "Opinionated News for Ticked Off People of the World." (If you're wondering why the title is so longwinded, you obviously don't know me very well... give it time.) Our goal is to make this a place where you can come to listen to people sit on their asses and complain about the issues that you sit on YOUR ass and complain about! Because I cannot lean any further right, politically speaking, without falling over and hurting myself, I've decided to get together with my liberal friend, Matt Collette, to create this publication. Only Fox News - one of the most middle-of-the-road TV stations ever secretly controlled by Ronald Reagon - has been able to provide such fairness and balance up to this point in time.   Some of you may be wondering why I'm writing an introduction to this website when my colleage has already done so. The reason is that his introduction sucks. First of all, he was very informal. Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for an informal publication. But in an editorial there is a certain professionalist feel that needs to be given. Second of all, he keeps calling this a "blog". I know that that is the technical name for this type of website, but we are merely using this form to create an online magazine.   I told him these things, and told him that he should fix it, though really I was thinking that I should have been the one to write it, anyway - I am, after all, the Editor in Chief. He suggested that I write my own if I wish, as it would showcase our differences. Well, I guess in that we have succeeded, for you can already see that he is wrong and I am right. T
