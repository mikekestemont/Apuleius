things are awesome there.&nbsp; I haven't posted for several months, but I will be posting more frequently now.
Kevin....  I've been waiting for a guy like Kevin for 8 years, pretty much since I came out.  Kevin's a wonderful guy and I can't wait to see what happens with him, he's completely turned my life around.  Before I met him, I was miserable, my life was going down the toilet in a torrent of water, but he's made me feel happy again and I can't thank him enough for it.  In November, I'm taking a BIG trip, but I don't exactly know where I want to go yet.  If things develop, I may go out to Brantford and see him, but right now I need to get to know him better.  I have feelings that I can't even begin to describe for him, and I know that may sound weird, but I haven't met anyone in all the years I've known I'm gay who makes me feel the way he does, I can't describe it, there are no words.   Kevin, I know you may be wondering why I'm writing about you and talking about you and all that.  I like you a LOT and I'm hoping that soon, I can say that you are my Wolfie.  You're a great friend, and I know that I could easily fall in love with you over time.  Talk to you soon.
The most wonderful thing happened this week.......    Last week was a SHITTY week, got gay bashed, and lost my job because of it, but this week has been AWESOME!!!....I've met the most wonderful guy that I could think of to meet, and I don't yet know where it's gonna go.  He lives in Brantford, Ontario, and I live in Calgary, Alberta, a little distance between us.  I honestly feel like it could work if things develop, but I'm not too sure, all the long distance relationships I've had before have always ended in a lot of pain, but there's something different about this one.  He's smart and funny, and he always manages to make me smile even when I feel like shit.  I get shivers down my spine when I talk to him and I can't stop thinking about him at times.  All day at work today, I was thinking about him and I've been SOOOO happy all day.  I kinda wish we lived in closer proximity, but circumstances are such that it's not possible at the moment.  I was planning to take a trip to Ontario in November anyways, but the person I'm going there to see is now going to be someone different.  The person I'm now going to be meeting is someone that I hope will be a VERY important, even integral part of my life and I hope that circumstances will change to such that either he can eventually move out here, or I out there.  I don't know, it feels like he may be someone that I could build a meaningful relationship with.
