aaaahhh there's loads to write about  I'm still too tired just now. Best holiday I've been on. I'll say more later.
I'm away to T In The Park.
I'm trying to do loan stuff. Just changed ma bank account to a student royalties one but al need to wait before a can use the overdraft. Stuck with ma Â£7 for now.
Here are some things I learned on holiday:  I'm a shitebag.   I'm a sicko.  Too much beer kills the dangly bit at the back of my mouth.  I can still cry without physical pain.  I don't get homesick.  I don't like fried bread as much as I thought I did.
There were loads of parts to ma dream last night but the weirdest one was we were at someone's house watching telly...it was someone we know am sure...and his big sister (doesn't exist in real life but looked like a lassie you see walkin about with her baby, she went to ma primary school) came in with a dinner for us all. Chips, peas, beans...and a big fuckin human foot. Hard skin on the toes too. And we (me and some pals) actually ate some of it. Then a thought about it and felt sick.
If the site is dead then I'll make a new one when I can be arsed. In about a hunner ages.  T In The Park this week. With no Bowie, sadly, but for now I say fuck Bowie and his dodgy shoulder. I'm going to get fucked and discover new bands. And chuck pebbles at Pink. I've been told the weather is set to be thunder & lightning, meaning I'm going to be mockit and fallin about everywhere. Can't wait.  My pc is fucked as well. I think it's a sign for me to stop sitting here numbing my arse and go out and do somethin. Get a job, probably. Shitey shitey.  I went to Universe on Thursday, the pub on Friday and the Palace on Saturday. It's all gettin a bit old now (even though I'd never been to universe before). The sooner we're all goin into Glasgow the better. Problem is I've got no ID so it could all be an expensive waste of time if I try to get in anywhere before ma birthday.   In a nutshell YAAAAAAAWWWWWWW
It's shite when you fuck something up and you know you can't fix it. That's it just f
