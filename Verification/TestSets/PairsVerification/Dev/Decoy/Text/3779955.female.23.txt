always try to get together and salvage what we had and make things the same.   I'm begining to realize that it will never be the same.  We all have different lives, different dreams than before.  We've grown up a lot.  We still struggle with the same stuff though, maybe even more now than before.  Our problems range from eating disorders, self esteem issues, to homosexuality and lust.  Anyway, one of the friends that I met with last night.. We got into a little tiff a couple years back and we didn't talk for a LONG time.  The sad thing is that I don't even remember what it was about.  Last night she mentioned that she didn't know if we were made up yet.  I would like everything in the world to be made up with her.  To have things comfortable and as open with each other as we were before.  I don't know if that could happen because of our differnet life situations.  I just want to give her a huge hug and apoligize if I hurt her in any way.  I don't want her feeling like I don't want to be her friend, or that I don't love her.  She is so special in my eyes and I'd hate for her to feel that.  Maybe I should schedule more time with her, just one on one.        Another issue with our old high school friends is that included in our friends is my ex fiance Oscar.  I haven't seen him or talked to him in a while.  I'll admit that for a while there I had issues with him, I was bitter and confused when it came to his name.  I'm not that way anymore. I have forgiven Oscar and out of the Lords love and grace for me I have been able to show him grace. Oscar was my first love, and he will always have a place in my heart.  I want him to know that he's forgiven for what happened, and I guess part of me needs to know that I'm forgiven as well.  I don't want him to feel like I resent him, or hate him, because I don't.  I miss having a friendship with him.  Trouble is that I can't get him around and I havent been able to talk to him to tell him this because he's so afraid to come around.        Anyway, friendships are complicated.  However, they are true, and have always been a blessing in my life.  My life has changed, I do have different dreams and goals and I have different friends.  I'm not saying that I'm going to leave all my old friends at all, I guess I just felt like it was hard to relate to them again because we are in different areas in our lives.  It was hard for me to explain to them why I wanted to join staff for Campus Crusade or Student Venture.  At the same time, it was still beautiful seeing them and talking to them and I wouldn't change those times for a
