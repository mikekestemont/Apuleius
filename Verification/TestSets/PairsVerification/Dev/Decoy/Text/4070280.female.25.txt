sometimes i feel like the whole world's against me everywhere i turn to, i end up unhappy i cry silently, my tears drop inside me my face keeps smiling, but my heart fails me...  although i try hard, i cannot understand people why are they so mean? why they don't care? is it always me? what am i missing to share? what am i doing wrong? why is this always the same?  why everybody comes and talks behind others' backs? do they do that to me too when i am the one who's not there? who should i trust? is there anyone out there? or should i live with it and look like i don't care?  i am sick of fake people, i wanna shout out loud! i am sick of tolerating them, i want to be heard too i don't wanna be the one who understands 'em no more the only thing i want is to be understood too!  everything is mutual i live one-sided if i'll live alone then&nbsp;leave me alone and don't be fake no more..  11:20am 30.09.2003 tuesday

(aunt & grandfather live together) coz then at least somebody would be happy:) i love my grandfather alot, but i was in the mood to spend the day outside somewhere coz the weather was fine.. but then i thought i've been such a bad granddaughter lately and haven't visited him as much as i used to be. so i decided i should make my gpa happy rather than going out n chilling..      so anyway, we went there.. i asked how gpa been, he said he has been resting today. (he had heart attack twice, and has been paralyzed twice too - after my granny passed away.. ) :/ so yeah he was weak today, he was resting. he also said he doesnt feel good coz its been two months i havent visited him. actually it wasnt two months but i used to visit weekly so if i disappear for a while, he misses us and thinks its been ages.. last i went there, he was sleeping and i only s
