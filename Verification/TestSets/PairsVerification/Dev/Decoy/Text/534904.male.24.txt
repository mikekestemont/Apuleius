atmosphere has sucked me dry of all desire to achieve something. Almost everything about the place is so fucking oppressive, it scares me. It makes me want to scream.   There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting. I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing. Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication. -MJ Keenan   One problem is that there's  no  communication. Students don't know wtf is going on, and the administration don't care what the students think. The only people that  do  know that things should be better are chastised for mentioning it.  Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck. Working up under my patience like a little tick, fat little parasite, suck me dry. My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards, you have turned my blood cold and bitter, beat my compassion black and blue.  Hope this is what you wanted, hope this is what you had in mind. Cuz this is what you're getting. I hope you're choking; I hope you choke on this. -MJ Keenan  Thanks for helping me make a point, and to express what I'm feeling, Maynard. You rock.
I should start a photo gallery or something on this site, with pictures of people & places. Maybe one day*  Anyway, in the meantime, here's a photo of my two bestest buddies in the whole wide world**  This is Kirra and  urlLink Neal  - She (Kirra) is currently moving house, and so here they are having a relaxing geekfest after a hard day's works packing stuff up.   urlLink    (apologies for the shit picture quality, but my camera is.. well.. shit)  So anyway - I feel extremely lucky to know these two people. If everybody were like these two people, the world would be pretty damned boring. Because everybody would be the same. But if there were just more people like these two, then the world would be a much better place, IMO    *probably never **assuming world is pretty fucking small*** ***not really
orsm
Well that didn't work too well - there was supposed to be a photo of my new bike in there somewhere =(
Test message... My new bike! Yay!
thanks for fixing the problem, mate =)
if you're using Internet Explorer to view this site, then don't be a fool - get  urlLink Firefox  instead. It's much better, more stable and less likely to lead your computer to a good old hax0ring.  I can't be fucked *  fixing the rendering problem     *I don't know enough HTML or CSS
well that didn't go too badly =) We spent like an hour eating and talking about nothing, even though we probably should have been talking about  something , but it all seemed good.  I'm just going to focus on the positives of all this from now on. I can't let one little thing from so long ago have such a hold over me anymore.  Now as long as I can remember that, I should be fine =
