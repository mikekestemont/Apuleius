Found this one the other day. It seems to be an alternative to 'scp' and just as secure. Remote backups using 'ssh' and 'tar'.  http://madpenguin.org/Article1505.html  This is an excellent method for archiving large amouts of data and maintaining directory structures. Have fun...
Holla at the /etc/passwd one time.  Don't know where to start, but I figure this link would be useful for everyone out there:     urlLink Security Audits and Such     It's got all the online security check links, plus all the tools you need to get started for most OSes :-)  Craig wonders when he'll get off his ass and upgrade his kernel to 2.6 and start playing with ipv6 as well.  Beat it, Craig
testing first post
urlLink Part 2  of  Craig's  original post on this subject matter. Good overview of AirSnort and light covereage of WEP cracking and weak IV's. Also, makes reference to a great tool ' urlLink Whisker '...I haven't seen anything from  urlLink rfp  in a while...  Ever feel like you are just talking to yourself... we need some more contributors =P  oh yeah...thanks  urlLink Dan  for this template!
Found this article on  urlLink securityfocus.com  -written by Mariusz Burdach   urlLink Forensic Analysis of a Live Linux System P I&II   Well worth the time to read this one. Excellent description and use of tools and logic. Also very descriptive on physical data collection as to not disturb the system, therefore destroying the integrity of the analysis. Good bedtime story for you security junkies out there.
urlLink darknet.   This is a great project from  urlLink Team Cymru  (found on /.). Can do it with a cheap linux or freeBSD box but you need a router with some functionality. All linksys router users may need to use a hacked firmaware. (the examples used in the project whitepaper are freeBSD/cisco).  harkens me back to the MRTG days with voltaire.uncg.edu  definatley a good read!
Came across this on security-focus today, while it's a bit dry I think the next two installments will be worth a read for sure:     urlLink Wireless Attacks and Penetration Testing (part 1 of 3)     My thoughts on the M$ vs. Linux is this:  M$ = scurred of the Open Source Community and what they bring to the table at little or no cost Linux = underdog, realizes their code is better than M$, but would rather let the code speak for itself and take away from M$'s revenue :-)  I have no idea how they say that linus didn't write the linux kernel, but I'd love to slap these fuckers in the face as they need to wake up and look at the facts :-)  Holla back, Craig
Ok, if you are just hearing about this some background will be provided. There is this douchebag Ken Brown who is writing a paper about the origins of open source and linux. You can find his M$ funded and puppeted institute  urlLink here . Anyway....Brown writes a very uninspiring peice accusing Linus of "stealing" a majority of code from Andy Tanenbaum's Minix OS. In the end all the major open source playas (torvalds, tanenbaum, and r
