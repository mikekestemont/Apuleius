Beth (this girl from ACT) was telling me on the train ride home about some guy she knows who's name is Harrison Balls. as in, Harry Balls. what kind of parents would like, inflict such emotional trauma on their children? another example: there was a guy at my elementary school named Frances Benederette the Third.  and i TOTALLY dont get the crazyass guys named richard who go by dick. like, ummm, whats wrong with rich? like, dick? that doesnt even SOUND like richard. and like, come on, theres no girls name that has the nickname "pussy." so why would you WANT to call yourself dick? weird. and parents really need to like, be more careful when they pick their kids names. Gwenyth Paltrow's baby's name is Apple. that kid is gonna be one FUCKED up child. anyone named apple is gonna have a hard time in life.

note to self: sleep for more than three hours the night before days you hafta sing.

why are victorias secret catalogs so provocative if they are mainly selling to women?
I love that i hafta wake up in like, 6 hrs or something and im still not even close to going to bed. its just like during the school year!! hahaha. u know what i really hate? when people ignore me online. especially when its like, 2 in the morning. like, its not like they have dozens of other people they are too busy talking to. at 2 in the morning its just plain rude. not that it isnt always rude.....
