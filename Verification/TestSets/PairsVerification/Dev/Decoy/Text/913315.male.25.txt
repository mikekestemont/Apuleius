Rex Morgan MD = SWASS!  All the time I've spent talking up Marmaduke, I completely forgot to mention Rex Morgan.  I know this is a comic that you all skip past because you starting reading the comics page as a kid, and Rex wasn't funny.  You need to get past that.  Rex is all about the drawings.  Screw the story.  There's always at least one frame that is a genuine work of art.  It would make  urlLink Roy Lichtenstein  jealous.  My favorite in this one has to be the last panel.  It's got action lines.   urlLink    this is what you've been missing!&nbsp; urlLink
Here's one for everyone in the Twin Cities  I don't want you guys to feel left out.  The Twin Cities is a seriously swass place.  Plus, you guys can claim Prince as your own.  Now some of you may not think Prince is too swass.  But seriously, look at this picture and tell me  urlLink the man  isn't  urlLink solid .   urlLink    Here's a picture of Prince playing the guitar so fast it's smoking.&nbsp; urlLink
HELP!  The computer I'm using whack.  So lately everytime I go on the web, a gazillion pop-ups come up.  They never stop.  It's gotten to the point that I spend more time closing those windows than using the page I want to.  And no, I'm not on the porn pages.  Also, lately it won't let me download any pictures.  That one really stinks, since I just learned how to post pictures.  Can someone tell me what the eff is going on?

Go to the site, see if you can be the first to unveil him. Or stay at this site, and bask in the swassness of the Gutte. Okay, so my computer sucks right now and I can't get the picture to work, but trust me, he's looking mighty swass.  Hopefully it'll be up tomorrow.   urlLink    Could this be the Gutte's Rance disguise?&nbsp; urlLink
Swass Fact #1  If you type "Freakin" into your post on blogger and do a spell check, it will recommend the word "foreskin".
Another Accomplishment for the Swass Report!  I'm taking this thing to a whole new level.  For all of my illiterate friends, I give you pictures!  For all of my computer illiterate friends, I think you smell bad.  It's not like they'll ever know.  Freakin' caveman hippies.   urlLink    bang the drums and drink champagne!
I'm going to make all of my friends look bad.  I've decided that in my spare time I will be working on an art series.  I will call it "Bad Paintings of Good Friends" or maybe "Bad Representations of Good Friends"  because while they may look like a deformed version of them, the painting itself may actually be pretty cool.  Then I will get them in a gallery and sell them.  Once sold, the owner will put it up on their wall where visitors will see i
