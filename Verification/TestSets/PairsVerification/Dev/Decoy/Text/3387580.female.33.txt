go. Jumped in and started heading East. Got to my Mom's house in Ohio at about 5:30 PM. Barely had time to have dinner and talk to my brother before I was ready to climb into my old bed for some much needed ZZZzzzzs. Left Mom's Sunday morning at about 9:30. and headed East again. Let me tell you.... PA is a LOOOOOOOONG mo-fo state. It seemed like we were never going to get through it. Somewhere along the way I found out on the cell phone from my Ex that not only had I signed on to drive... she was also expecting me to help unload the stuff at my ex-house on the cape on Monday. So I had THAT to look forward to. So anyway... I never thought I would be so happy to finally see New Jersey. Actually, unlike most of NJ, the part that you enter on RT 80 from PA is quite beautiful. The area is called the Delaware Water Gap. So... after that it was over the Tappan Zee Bridge and through CT on Rt 95 and then the long trek from Providence to the Cape on 195. Actually that's not that far, but because it was the last leg of the trip it seemed like forever. It's really hard to drive a big truck so far. It's not like a car where you can put it in cruise control and kinda zone out. You have to be paying attention every second. I found myself wondering how guys that do long hauls for a living can do it? Anyway... got into Harwich at 12:30 AM and went to sleep as soon as possible. Unfortunately I had to sleep on an air mattress because all the furniture was still in the truck. I could not BELIEVE when my Ex sent the kids to wake me up at 7:30 in the fricken AM! I wanted to cry. I got up and went to work unloading, with one other guy and the kids. I sweated my whatever off until about noon and then I had enough. I could have gotten a ride home from her friend if I had stayed until the night time, but I REALLY wanted to get back to KA and I knew she had some other people coming over later to help bring the boxes and small stuff in from the lawn. So... I drove the truck to where it needed to be dropped off in Hyannis and had her drop me off at the bus station. I ran into my old roommate from right after I got separated at the restaraunt near the bus station and it was very cool to see him. The bus ride to South station was nice. Very comfy and I took a nap. Then the Red line to the Green Line to North Station and the train home. I keep thinking... if only I had taken a boat and rode a camel, I would have covered all bases this weekend. Respectfully submitted, Butterchunk
