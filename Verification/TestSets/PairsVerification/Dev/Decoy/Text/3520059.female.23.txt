stop there.  When I get my pictures developed I will post some of them.   I have to get back to work (break time is over).  When I have more time I will write about what God did in  my  life at Frontliners.  God Bless, LB      For the word of God is living and active.  Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Hebrews 4:12
Last night was AWESOME!  I was surprised and elated to see my friends Becky, Justin and Jodi at church last night.  See, they live in the Clear Lake/Pasadena area of Houston and I don't get a chance to see them very often.  God has totally annointed those three people and gifted them with the voices and musical talent to serve others by being a worship band.  They announced last night that they are beginning to raise money to make their first CD (they need about $5,000).  If anyone reading this would like to give to their ministry or if you would like to book them for an event/service, I have included their info below. Also, I have posted a picture of Bec and Justin leading worship at DNOW in January 2004 at FBC Willis.  I am so glad that God has blessed me with their friendships and with the opportunity to be able to hear them lead others into His presence.  THEY ARE AWESOME, and I highly recommend them!!!    Also, my sister had a doctors appt today in Houston.  Our faithful church family surrounded her and prayed for her last night.  It was such an encouragement and a blessing. Jamie was diagnosed as having nodules (kind of like small tumors) on her thyroid a couple of weeks ago.  Well, the specialist told her today that a biopsy is not needed.  Instead, he told her that she has Hashimoto Thyrotis (I probably spelled that incorrectly).  She has to go back to the doctor next Thursday to have more tests run.  Please continue to pray for her!     Undone Ministries   c/o Justin Cheatwood  4423 Arapajo St.  Pasadena, Texas 77504   OR  email Justin at: justin594@hotmail.com

Hey guys!  It's been a couple of weeks, but I just wanted to let you know that Jamie and I are headed to Lubbock this Saturday.  If you are in Lubbock... give us a call so we can get together.  I have missed all of y'all.  For those of you who are in the Houston or Dallas area... keep in touch.  I will try to continue to blog in between reading and going to class.  Please be praying for me as I begin my second year of law school; Lord knows I need it!  Talk to ya soon.   p.s. I attached some pictures from Amber's birthday party in downtown Houston and from Frontliners in Willis (the other two girls were our host 'sisters').    The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.  James 5:16
