A couple of days ago another video was posted on the Microsoft Channel 9 site with Ward Cunningham as the subject. In the video, he was answering a question on whether there is a revolution coming in the way people communicate. The very last part of the video resonated with me:   At one point we thought it was easy to explain things, but we deal with ideas that are so complicated, in the world, that we have to practice saying it to find a way to articulate what matters.   I've been thinking about whether to start a blog for a while now - at least just to give it a go.  urlLink The Ward Cunningham video  and an  urlLink entry on Scoble's blog  on quotes in  urlLink blogger  put me over the edge and I decided to start blogging.  The idea is that a blog will help me articulate my thoughts on software development and to become better at communicating to other software developers (Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it). The entries may peter out after a month or so, but hey... it's worth a go just for the experience.
Microsoft just made available Beta-1 of the  urlLink Visual Studio Express  range of software developer tools. For some reason the C++ guy in particular made me think of the marketing/web people that created that particular web page. The choices of people/models used to represent each of the different express product options may give an insight into what Microsoft Marketing thinks of each of the target developer markets for the Express range of products:   Visual Basic dude. Young, clueless and not really paying attention.  C# Dudette. Young, capable and way too serious.  C++ Dude. Late 20s, Early thirties. Bohemian. Gonna stick with his esoteric ways. Likes being&nbsp;in a&nbsp;niche area because it makes him feel special.  Java Dude. Middle aged guy. Uses a blackboard which implies being more academic (and hence not so practical and realistic).  Web Girl. Young and it looks like she's&nbsp;focused on what she's doing - when in reality she's actually snoozing at the keyboard from a hard night out on the town with the girls.  SQL Dude. Middle aged guy - wears a tie, so he must be dependable and serious about business.   I'd love to see a  urlLink causticTech  interpretation of the  urlLink page . He'd do it way more justice than my&nbsp;pathetic attempt.  PS: Programming language wide, I'd class myself as a C#, C++ and Java dude - in that order.
I followed this  urlLink dotnet.tv  link via  urlLink Ingo Rammer's blog . Lot's of fun with analogies and an enjoyable view. One of the comments asked for sub-titled versions of the earlier videos that were done in German. I'd definitely view them if sub-titled versions were available. Of course, English versions would be preferable - but just from the ability to bring up a video and be able to keep up with the story-line while doing something else at the computer that is more mundane. As the visuals are part of the primary content b
