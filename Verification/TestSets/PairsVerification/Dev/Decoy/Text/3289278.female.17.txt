What did I learn in webmastering. Well  nothing!!  Nah just playing I learned a lot about computers. I mean I already new how to use the internet but I learned how to make a webpage to show the whole world who I am. Isn't that cool, Something that I enjoy. I love writing and giving advice.   Here with Mr. Rae I learned not only about computers but about myself and others. I learned that Mr. Rae can be a butt head but sometimes cool.
