Letter From a Concerned Follower (Pedro the Lion on his EP "The Only Reason I Feel Secure is that I'm Validated By My Peers")   it's weird to think of all the things that have not been keeping up with the times it's ten o'clock the sun has now just begun to set the western hills on fire  i hear that you don't change how do you expect to keep up with the trends you won't survive the information age unless you plan to change the truth to accommodate the brillance of men the brillance of men  some folks think we're better now social evolution's new synthetic will will keep us on the straighter path as better men use brand new math with no wrong answers  i'm just a little bit worried do you have some sort of plan have you been finally defeated by the cunning of these fully evolved men   Psalm 40:4-5 (translated by Eugene Peterson in "The Message")   Blessed are you who give yourselves over to God, turn your backs on the world's "sure thing," ignore what the world worships; The world's a huge stockpile of GOD-wonders and God-thoughts.

Since I had been first introduced to Crusade I had always had my doubts, but that year I found that the “answers” I had been taught were simply unhelpful tips from the evangelical party-line.
