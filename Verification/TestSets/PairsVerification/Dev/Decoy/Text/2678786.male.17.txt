I think I've zeroed in on the passage from Al Franken's book that most positively affected me in the direction towards liberalism. I'll quote (and cite-I don't want to get in trouble(it's not illegal if you dont try to make money off it, is it?)) it: "We love America just as much as [conservatives] do. But in a different way. You see, they love America the way a four-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a four-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow. Love takes attention and work and is the best thing in the world.      That's why we liberals want America to do the right thing. We know America is the hope of the world, and we love it and want it to do well. We also want it to do good." (Al Franken,  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right  (Dutton, 2003), 24)      This passage articulated for me the difference between conservatives and liberals that I had felt before reading this. (Warning:disclaimer coming) This is not to say that I completely agree with Al Franken or that I actually believe that all conservatives are like "four-year-olds." Rather it just helped me to understand what being a liberal means for me. I hope I have not seriously offended those friends of mine who lean to the right, but I felt that I needed to elaborate some on last night's comments.
so in my first blog ever, I mentioned an urge to do what other people around you are doing (basically to want to be involved in fads and even fashion). wow, it's amazing to think back over all of the fads that I got involved in (some good/some "bad"(ie not worthwhile)) I'll try to list the major or most memorable ones. The first thing I remember claiming as a favorite anything is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (and rightly so), but I don't believe other kids influenced me into liking them. The next that I can remember is Power Rangers. Agh. That was not beneficial. It was a rather uncool (compared to tmnt) show from the start, and now that it has been rehashed so many times... The only reason I got involved with the power rangers was because of the hype over it at school. Everyone else seemed to be watching it, and I had never heard of it before. I had picture some sort of western cowboy theme before i actually got the chance to see the show. and once I discovered my misinterpretation of the name, I readily dismissed the fact and accepted the show as my new favorite because my friends liked it. simply because they did, i did. next came star wars cards. now those were cool. and they still are. i plan to keep them as collectors items, but more just for my personal enjoyment (yes, I a
