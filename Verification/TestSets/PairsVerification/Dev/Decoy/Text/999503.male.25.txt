I have done such a good job for so long pusing aside my personal feelings, wants, and desires... now they all seem to be piling up on me.  Part of me is glad I feel alone, because at least it means Im not hurting anyone else...   But there is that duality too... I cant accept that, otherwise I would not feel alone...    I think about her wanting to meet my parents...   I couldnt afford to give her the life I would want to give her... Im so far in debt right now... I wonder if I will end up my fathers son afterall.
I never said this before, but my Dad is in Jail.  Funny thing is I am kind of glad he got what he diserved and I hope they keep him for a while...  I doubt they will though.

As long as I can remember my Dad has always had a drinking problem.  When he drinks he gets confrontational and violent, at times we would try and be quiet to just try and not wake him up if he was sleeping... he always seemed grumpy.  My mom and him would always argue and fight.... Generally over stupid trivial things, not anything I would deem important.   Just about any time there was a verbal argument it turned into a physical thing with my dad hitting my mom.   When I was really young I was powerless to stop it, we would leave and go to the house of my moms friends or stay with relatives to get away from him if it got really bad.  I remember one time when I was living at Camp lake, my dad got really drunk and we were all scared, we went down to my Aunt Kathy's house and were hiding in the bedroom.
