Edgar Martinez is the last person who would want a fuss made over him, we should feel fortunate he announced his retirement this week. Now we can come to the stadium these last two months and cheer him as if he were our neighbor and give him the thoughtful long goodbye he deserves.  We can say, "Thanks, Edgar."  Thanks for enriching our lives with your skills. And for making it feel, at times, as if you really were our best friend.
I was thinking about this song the other day from U2 - All That You Can't Leave Behind. The song is basicaly a pleed to God to let him see the world how God does, because when he looks at the World all he sees are the bad things.  When you look at the world  What is it that you see?

As I was thinking I pictured a little glob in my head and I was looking down on it seeing all the bad things, armies marching across nations and planes crashing into buildings, ect. Then I started thinking about God and how he could let it go on. Then it hit me, if you look really close you can see why, you have to look past the surface, the nations, the things that go on on a major scale, look past all that to the little things. To people who love their children, to great friendships, to little boys helping old women across the street, to people smiling at oneanother as they walk past at the grocery store, to people working in a food bank, to people giving there time, and lives to help others. If you add all these things up, there is more good in this world then there is bad.  This was really encouraging to me, thought I would s
