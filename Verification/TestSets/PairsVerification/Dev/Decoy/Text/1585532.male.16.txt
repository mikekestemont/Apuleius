Ahhh, the greatness of technology, computers, the internet, and computer crashes.....Yup, thats right, my computer crashed this last thursday night, and I'm now screwed because I have no pictures for MLIP.  I'm still trying to scrounge some up, but it's looking pretty dismal.  I'll of course though, keep working on the site, and hopefully next week (4th of July, where something weird is BOUND to happen), I'll have some pictures.  I'm uploading stuff so uh, ta.
Okay, I told you all how I got alittle too creative with my Star Wars, crap right?  Well you'll get to see that, its kinda disturbing...Anyways I'm going to Knott's tommorrow!  Woo-hoo!  Okay, over it.  Yeah I get to do some photos for a website since the admin's too busy to do it right now.  I've done photos for him before.  The place would be http://kweb.us.  Anyways, nothing much new going on in my life.  Bought a new CD, Rammstein Live Aus Berlin.  Nice CD.  Just a live concert from Berlin, all there songs.  In other news, my friend has set up her message boards here http://www.bigassgoldfish.com/community/.  Meh, its all hot in here, going to go dump some water on me or something...Ta.
Well I'm back!  And with pictures too.  Theres about 35 or something of them, and thats all you'll be able to see about my life this week due to the fact that I have to do some photo work for another website.  I actually ditched Sea World because it was lame as hell!  I went to this place called Belmont Park and rode the Giant Dipper.  It was pretty damn good.  It was like built in 1925 or something.  Anyways after that I went to Knott's and rode some coasters and crap, took a few pictures of things there too.  Anyways I'm hungry as hell right now.  So I'm going to eat some food.  Ta.
Well, I'm going on hiatus for the next two days.  I've finally finished My Life In Pictures Week One though so that's there for your viewing displeasure.  As you all know, I'm going to SeaWorld.  Hope you guys can live without me for a small time.  See you all later!
O. M. G!  School's finally out!  We're completly done now!  All I have to work out is summer school....blah.  MLIP is going very well!  It looks like it's going to be up on Friday.  I'm not really sure about how I'm going to keep schedules, but it will work out eventually.  Anyways the last day of school was fun!  I ripped up my math final and went online...but I accidently showed my friends "Robb and Elissa's Cedar Point Trip."  That was not the best idea.....And Amy, thats a scary as hell picture of Robb!  What did people do to deserve to see that!?  Anyways, I'm gonna go do some stuff...get ready to go to SeaWorld, which is going to be um....interesting.  Anyways, later!
