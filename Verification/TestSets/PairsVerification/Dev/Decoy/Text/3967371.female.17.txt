Waiting for Waiting for the night to change your ways There are days missing from my week again And there's not a cloud in the sky But my view from the Hollywood Roosevelt Makes me feel like I can fly I should maybe make some apologies And I probably should fix my hair But I might just stay another night If my credit card's still down there Oh yeah, all right I feel like a hundred million dollars tonight I knew you were the one But I kept you waiting Kept you waiting Anticipating now I'm waiting for you I think I'll go see my friends tonight Who live just a little bit up Crescent Heights And sometimes we stay out all night Feels like there's nothing that we can't do I'm never really sure that I'll ever change But if it makes you happy then I will lie She looked at me and softly said I'm going to love you till the day I die Oh yeah, all right I feel like a hundred million dollars tonight I knew you were the one But I kept you waiting Kept you waiting Anticipating now I'm waiting for you I miss the things you told me I'll be waiting for you I just wish you would hold me I'll be waiting for you If you decide to change your mind I'll be waiting for you I miss the things you told me I'll be waiting for you I'll be waiting there for you waiting there for you waiting there for you waiting there for you I keep waiting anticipating you   It's a song by Sugar Ray that made me drown in my thoughts today... hehehe...

As I was preparing to leave, I saw a Maroon5 truck parked in front of my house. I saw Adam Levine walk out with spotlights hovering onto him. I think I shouted... "I love you ADAM!"     &nbsp;   I still have it with the Maroon 5 fevah...      &nbsp;   Then, as I was leaving, I was sitting in a cocoon. It was supposed to be my cabin. I ouldn't quite understand what was under my cocoon... sand or cement. It felt like cement but it was supposed to be sand. Then the cocoon flipped. I went out and told my mom, while holding the cocoon in my hands... THIS SIMPLY CAN'T work. Then I woke up realizing that I'm late.     &nbsp;   Now, it's free cut again. hehehe. I can't just quite imagine why our teacher won't teach us... I think he's on extended vacation... He earned it anyway handling little demons like us...&nbsp;grin again.     Anyway, I want to tell about my new installation on my write-on journal. Extremely random thoughts, fiction writing using a first person's POV... a story of my future self... my future rich self to be exact. grin    I'll type it down when I have time... If I get a
