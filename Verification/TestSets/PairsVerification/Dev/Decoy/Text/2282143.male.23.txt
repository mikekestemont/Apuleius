her.&nbsp; All I can do really.  Tae Kwon Do is insanity.&nbsp; I feel lame for not keeping up lately, but I have had other things to do.&nbsp; Im back up to 225 which makes me sad, but I know as soon as I get the chance, I will be back in full swing and that will drop in no time.&nbsp; So yeah.&nbsp; Also I found out the plan that Mohammed is trying to do.&nbsp; I found out that Todd is his little lackey in the matter and is snitching to him.&nbsp; And I wonder what their friendship is because every time I talk to Mohammed, he is making fun of Todd.&nbsp; But I guess they hang out, so whatever.&nbsp; I have gone back to not trusting Todd.&nbsp; I feel kinda sad about this, because I was just starting to accept him as a person.&nbsp; Now I feel like what the both of them are doing is sneaky and underhanded and I wish they would realize the values that we strive for, the same ones that I based this site on, are found by hard work and dedication, not on what a piece of paper says you are.&nbsp; So in&nbsp;my mind, they are nothing but neophytes in the world of martial arts.&nbsp; They are in it for rank, title, and the ability to hurt someone.&nbsp; To feel power over others.&nbsp; To feel superior.&nbsp; Makes me sad really.&nbsp; As for me, look to the right and see my quote to&nbsp;understand why I do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now off to do&nbsp;some stretching and possibly a light work out on my own.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; I ripped my pocket&nbsp;on my shorts and now I am sad.&nbsp; It happens...&nbsp;&nbsp;
So where the heck do I begin?  Life has been quite insane the past few weeks.  Busy.  Working at the zoo five days a week now.  Busy on my days off.  Trouble touching the computer whenever I want to write anything, because even though there are two of them, I never get the chance to use either.  Ive spent alot of time with Sammy lately and that has been a blast.  Enjoying the simple things of summer.  That and coming home to pass out after working all day.  TKD has been cut down, but I hope to pick that up in a bit.  Not much I can do with that, as its just getting harder to get there after work.  I mean, I get out at 630 when class starts, so I end up going late and I just dont get the workout I want.  Oh well.  Im rushing and drifting.  I need to realign.  Set my life on the center and work from there.  Stay with the present.  When I rush, bad things happen.  Right Sam?  hehe.  I still feel like a moron for that...  What it is, its so dumb, Im not saying.  Ok, well, off to enjoy another summer pleasure.  Gonna take Pips to the splash park that just opened up by my house.  Nothing fancy, just a good way to get wet and enjoy the afternoon.  Y
