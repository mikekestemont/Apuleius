Yesterday I sat in church, and despite being very interested in Graeme's thoughts on why we should stop sinning if we know in advance we will be forgiven, my mind kept wandering off on it's own.  I so rarely have that very focussed "I'm on the ball" feeling anymore.  I wonder if it is an age thing or just that I am tired.  Hard to say.  G actually slept through the night on Saturday, so I should have been hopping mentally on Sunday, but I wasn't.  B was wicked Sunday afternoon, and took a paracetamol capsule I had put on the table and ate it.  I put it down, went and picked up G, came back to have them, and the little toad had snavelled them, and eaten one, holding the other in her hot little hand.  Rang the Poison's Info Hotline for the second time in 8 days.  I wonder how long it takes for them to sic DOCS onto you?  Apparently one paracetamol for a 2 year old won't do irreparable damage.  Lucky.  She really is a ratbag.  We spent the weekend working on the hammock for G.  It is up and running now, and she is lying in it sleeping as I type.  It's just magic, I am so pleased with it.  J did a beautiful job on the hanger,and the sling bit which I ran up looks quite fine too.  But the best thing is she likes it.  What's not to like?  It looks so comfy, the boys both asked if they could have one.  J rang a little while ago, he has been perusing the real estate pages and found a beautiful house inBlaxlnad.  So much for the extension.  Although the way I feel with the very cramped conditions in this house, I would be happy to move.  Well sort of.  I love it here, I love the boys being able to walk to school, I love the neighbours, and the street, and everything really, except the house is too small.  We are absolutely crammed into such a weeny space.  6 people in three (small) bedrooms, and one bathroom.  The toilet issue is a pretty big one actually.  However did the Brady Bunch manage?  Still getting organised for the business launch.  I made a sleeping bag/blankie thing for G yesterday, and took it out this morning to M&M's (good advertising), it was much admired, and I suspect I will get some business if I can strike while the proverbial iron is hot.  Must get my bum into gear.  Is bum a proper swear word?  I m trying to stop swearing.  It's a very bad example to the boys, and I really don't want them to do it.  Trying to cut saying "frig" to.  It's such an ugly word, and quite satisfying, but I heard D say it on the weekend, and its not a bit nice.  There are chocolate biscuits in the fridge that I am trying not to eat.  I am tired of being fat, I know I like it much better when I a
