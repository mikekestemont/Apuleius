Whooops      So Stephanie and I decided to go to the Valley after school today, but she had to drop off her car at her dads work first. So I am following her to his office and as she’s speeding down that street by the back of school doing like 45 I am thinking "Jesus, I am going to get a ticket trying to keep up with her, or get in an accident, oh Jesus I am going to die" but we don’t really read in to things like that because we all know I tend to be a little dramatic, right?  Anyway things are going great until we are sitting at some stoplight on capital. I absolutely have to have my cell phone right that instant for some reason I don’t remember and its some where in my backpack which is on the passenger side seat. SO I am digging around in my bag looking for it, but I see Steph's break light go off and her car start to go forward so I take my foot off the break and start to go and I continue looking for my cell phone. Then the next thing I knew my car is going in to Stephanie’s, “I am like ssshitt”, and I can see her laughing hysterically in her car.   SO we continue driving to her dad’s work, where we get out and inspect the damage (NONE, god loves me) but I still felt like a retard for rear-ending my friend. But I guess what happened was the lady in front of Steph had slammed on her breaks so Steph had to slam on hers and since I was not paying attention the only thing I slammed was the back of Steph’s car.

It's a musical moment      Today was nice. Went to church. Went to some more grocery stores with my sister (i feel an addiction develpoing) and updated my music collection:  9 days- another day  Here's another day, she waits and pulls herself away At just the right moment to save her face I watch the time go ticking down, the waters falling on the ground I catch myself and try to speak with grace You needed just enough anger, to get you through the door And you got just enough honesty, to make you want a little more  I wish for nothing but the rain, to fall and wash away Everything that I've done wrong, find a way to make you strong If only for another day  When I'm all alone, just me and my ghosts Standing three deep, just like sentries at their post They make sure I remember, just a little more than most They make sure that I understand the consequence of past  When you see me chasing daydreams and you know that I'm not there, I'm not the one who sits a
