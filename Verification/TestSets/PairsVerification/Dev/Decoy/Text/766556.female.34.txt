Well, I've finally taken to reading other people's blogs and I've found that diving into the minds and lives of others can be quite refreshing.  I have also recently reviewed one of those internet profiles of a friend I thought I knew.  Apparently, I never even knew his real name and have been calling him by an alias all these years (yeah right).  His profile describes someone only vaguely like the man I thought I knew.  It's like finding out your husband is a secret agent for the CIA after 15 years of marriage - you saw the movie.    Anyway, as I am terminally honest in all aspects - even internet life (perish the thought) I find it extremely funny that we feel that we need to embellish online.  The internet has provided us with endless opportunities to communicate with our friends & loved ones, to express our ideas and beliefs, and to meet that hottie we've always dreamed of.  Trouble is, once you meet face to face you discover that you prefer the online fantasy to reality.  Oh, and I immediately deleted all quotes and quibbles from MY profile - no one would ever believe anyone is that perfect... they'd just assume embellishment. ;)
More Ying & Yang  Reviewing my last entry, I realize that I only gave one ying & yang example.  I could give more, like how great it is that my youngest daughter is home after living with her grandmother for the past three months.  It's great having her back where she belongs, but it's not great waking up three times in the night - bottle break, potty break and day break.  She was up at 6:45 am saying "Mommy, its a little bit morning, time to wake up!"    Gotta take the good with the bad, right?    And have another cup of coffee to get me through the day.
As I burned my tongue on my oatmeal this morning, I started thinking about how my life has lately been a pure example of ying & yang; a complete balance of good & bad.  Examples being first of all, I had to cancel a very chi-chi dinner I had planned to include a 5 course meal under a full miami moon, oceanside with 4 french wines to accompany the meal.  Masquerade, gourmet cuisine, great people - to say the least I was extremely dissapointed in what, to me, represented complete and utter failure on my part.  But then, on the day of the cancelled dinner, someone handed me an article extolling another, past event that I put together.  The writer, bless him, described the event as cozy and refreshing with the company of "gentle folk".  As, he described it exactly as I remember it - and I felt really good to know that someone else besides myself really enjoyed the fruits of my labor.  So I am once again reminded that you take the good with the bad.  Even when I am at my lowest point, it takes so little to bring me back to the sunny side of l
