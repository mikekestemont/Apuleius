the commercial breaks but when Dr. Phil comes back on she's like punching him in the arm to shut the fuck up. Her own brother is getting punched in the arm so this girl can hear Dr. Phil drawl about how crack cocaine kills babies. I doubt Dr. Phil would condone that.   Shit tell these assholes to spend 5 hours a week reading instead who knows what could happen. I doubt CNN would be so popular.
Vacation:  Ottawa sucked ass because it's what Ottawa does best. Jesus Christ if there was a nation wide sucking contest, Ottawa would finish in the top five.  Oh and if I see one more girl wearing one of those dust ruffle skirts I swear my eyes will vomit.  ***  Didn't do much. Planned to do all this really neat stuff like hang out at the pool all day and read, which sounds a lot cooler than it is which is why I didn't do it. Wanted to get shit done around the house, my apartment is like a shack, it needs so much work. I get a lot of offers from my brother and my guy friends to help with the floors etc, the only thing they seem serious about is knocking down that wall in the living room, which I will gladly do myself with all of the pent-up rage I have. Who needs men.  Anyway... didn't do shit exept for re-arrange my bedroom at 5:00 in the morning so that my bed is closer to the a/c and I can finally sleep at night.

Like eating more pie because it tastes good even though you're full. Anyway, he had this big fat cock but no idea how to use it. And the next day he was hungover and puked in my wobbly toilet, which would have been hilarious but I was too tired to get up and laugh at him.  ***  Never heard from him again and never used his phone number even though I promised I would because the rule is this:  if, on a scale from 1-10, the sex is less than a 5, you don't get a second chance.   I made this rule becuase I know sex will be bad the first time. It always is. But that doesn't mean that I have anything to prove. Why go through that embarassment and bad times again when I can just dig out the old vibrator and forget bad sex happens to good p
