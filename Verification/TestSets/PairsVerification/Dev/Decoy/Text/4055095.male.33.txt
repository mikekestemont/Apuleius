 I could be hit by a drunk driver or someone could go ballistic in the store.  After a few weeks, the threatening incident will be pushed to the backs of our minds and we won't be so worried.  But when things like that happen, they make you stop and think about how easily we can lose the life we've been given.
Stayed up til almost 2:00 a.m. this morning (I never stay up that late).  I went to my sister's house and watched a movie with her, her husband and our nephew (who was in town visiting a friend).  We watched "Go" again.  My sister loves that movie.      Ever woke up and felt like someone has beaten the crap out of you?  That's the way I've been feeling the past couple of mornings.  I've slept really hard and probably didn't move an inch all night long.  But then when I wake up in the morning, I feel all haggard like I could probably sleep some more.  Yet I can't go back to sleep.  So off I go in inject my body with Starbucks Breakfast Blend.      After getting out of bed, I decided to pay a couple of bills and get those out of the way.  Rent's due today, but since it's Sunday, I won't get it to them until tomorrow.  I'm now paying all of my bills online, with the exception of one.  It's such a breeze.  And I no longer have to worry about whether or not our wonderful postal service will get my payments to their appropriate destinations.  I don't mean to knock the U.S. post office because considering the sheer amount of mail they handle daily and the low cost of mailing a letter, overall they do a great job.

Bank One won't allow me to do online payments unless I have a checking account with them.  Whatever.      After paying those two bills, I was a little surprised to see my checking account getting kinda low.  I'm not saying I'm rich or anything because I definitely am not.  But I like to keep a little bit of a "padding" in my checking account, just in case.  Not too much, just a few hundred extra dollars.  (I was able to do this by cashing in my 401k when I quit a previous job.  I was young, what did I know about 401k's?)  I think I've indulged a bit too much now.  My padding is slowly wearing away!  It's making me think hard about whether I really need to be paying $24.00 a month for Netflix.  Once you get used to living with certain luxuries, it's hard to go back.  You begin to feel as though you need them and can't live without them.  I've forgotten what it is like to live without broadband internet or movies being mailed to me.  I've become spoiled (or more spoiled than what I w
