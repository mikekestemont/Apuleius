I leave for Shanghai on Saturday morning. Not a moment too soon 'cause I'm going nuts in that hotel. I'm staying in a serviced apartment in Shanghai, and its close to the office too. I'm hoping that it'll be a lot more fun to be there instead of the rotting cesspool of boredom and despair called the 'Park Hotel.'  Since I’ve been here I've gone to this little sushi restaurant near my hotel a few times. Its a conveyor belt restaurant with the sushi traveling around the 'bar' and you take what you want and the colour of the plate denotes the cost of the piece. Its pretty cheap too. I usually spend between $60-80HKDs which is like $11-15CDN and its really good quality and so efficient it has to be Japanese. I can't believe there isn't one of these in Toronto. There is a trick to the seating though. Try and get a place close to the beginning of the conveyor where the food comes out. if you are at the end of the line odds are there isn't going to be any tuna pieces left. Another funny thing is the big sign saying service with a smile. Well I'm not too sure about that, because the food preparers all wear SARS masks. I'm seeing a lot of those around. It’s kinda creepy.  Another thing about Hong Kong is the fascination with elevator music. I'm talking about rip-off instrumental stuff that is not really played anywhere in North America anymore. And this stuff is played everywhere here. At least in the tourist areas and restaurants. And it’s really annoying, because frankly is gets stuck in your head and there is little you can do to get it out.     Talk to y'all later.
The most shocking experience I have had so far in Hong Kong is something that I should really dismiss. It has to do with lunch today... Has anyone seen the classic guilty pleasure movie 'Demolition Man'? Well if you want to its ususally on TBS once a week on average. But in this bad 1990s action flick there was a scene when Sly Stallone, after being frozen for 40 years or something, gets invited to a restaurant. The place they go is Taco Bell. But not the Taco Bells we are used to. A futuristic, classy version, that Taco Bell only wishes it could be and that I'm sure they paid a lot of money to the producers to make it look like. Well for lunch today we went to Pizza Hut. When I first heard this I was like, I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to Pizza Hut? Not too impressed with the idea. But not wanting to be the annoying new guy I went along. I was shocked! Somewhere between Toronto and Hong Kong Pizza hut got classy. This was not fast food. It was a nice family restaurant. Food still sucked, but it looked better then a lot of fancy places I've been to. I couldn't stop thinking about that scene in Demolition Man. I
