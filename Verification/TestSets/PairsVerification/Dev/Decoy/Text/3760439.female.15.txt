okay, so....The dance thing was very entertaining.  They did a great job!  im sure they will all place for nationals..no doubt.  But anywho, the sleepover at Anna's was interesting and fun at the same time.  Anthony and Sam came over to hango out with us untill about 11.  Me, Sam, Kash, and dibble just hung out under anna's staircase where she has that little "Secret Room"  Its soo cozy and fun....well it was fun until SOMEONE WANTED THE LIGHTS COMPLETELY OFF.  Hmm...WONDER WHO.  Anyways.  Once TONY and sam Left...we got bored, so we prank called people for a while...(yah...SORRY, that was us.)  And then Anna called Anthony to come pick us up to sneek out.  So ususally, when you sneek out at around 3 in the morning...you usually want to make it un-suspicious right?  Well...that didnt go over too well.  Instead of normally walking out the back door...we had to climb through this dirty, dark ,spider-webby, hole in anna's garage.  It was untill i started craking up cause i couldnt fit.  haha.  But moving on...we went to sam's house and just hung out and attempted to watch "The gladiator."   Instead Kash and I fell asleep for a while, while ali gave massages, and Anna and TONY did...."cough cough"....u know what.  (But shes private.)   shh.  :)                        Tonight I have poms from 5:00-7:00.  Im sick of it already.  Lets just face it.  The fucking dance isnt going to get any cleaner than it already is.   Im planning on hanging out with Ant, sam and the chicks after poms....but i dont know if my mom will let me, casue i was kinda a bitch on the boat to her today.  CRAZYNESS.     But Today....umm, i had fun Tanning with my Tanning buddy  (HANNA)  Wel tanned at my lake house....AND ON THE BOAT.  I tell ya, those water reflections really do help the tan.  haha     ~Skin cancer is gunna suck when im 30.  :(
Woohoo..Well tonight im heading over to The PAC at middleton to go watch the dance thingy, like i said before.  But then after wards we are all heading over to anna's for a late night, i will let you know how that goes tommarow morning.    But in the meantime, im off to tanning in my back yard.    -Skin Cancer HERE I COME!
Well Tubing ended up to be pretty fun.  I only fell off umm...about 3 times. lol.  It was fun though.   But unfortunaly...im extremely sore.  Too much tubing can wear a girl out!  But The sleep over was fun.  We watched "Catch that kid"  And "Along came polly"  But i didnt get to finish "Along came polly" cause i was tired and i fell asleep.  I ate so much last night, its not even funny!  But me, Anna, Kash, and Ali were thinking about sneeking out and meeting up with Anthony...(Anna's boyfriend).   But then our minds changed.  I dont really know why.  Ali's mom told us the fucking ALARM SYSTEM was on...but when i opened the door...nothing happend.  haha.  Her mom came down about hmm...lets see....like 90 TIMES! to check up on u
