while I am mainly a mouth-breather, it isn't enough to where I should need anything done with my nose.  Some cartilage is bent more than it should be which causes my right nostril to be clogged moreso than my left one, but it was nothing important.  I don't know about you, but that's enough nostril talk to last me a while.
It's about time.  I just received my paycheck last Friday and it just cleared today - I am finally out of debt!  I owed my mom about $1,000 for my car's tires and rims.  With my last paycheck, it pushed my bank account's balance to over $1,200 so I no longer owe anyone any money!  Today I was called into work an hour early by my general manager.  I arrived at work and the manager asked me why I was clocking in an hour early; I told her I was called in.  She said that she doesn't need me until around 2 in the afternoon (it was noon) when a 3-hour adventure party was coming in.  Once again our schedule is screwed up.  But hey, I got paid to stand up front and do pretty much nothing for an hour so I can't complain.  I have tomorrow off!  I've earned it too - it's the only day I have off this week.  When this week is over, I'll have worked about 35 hours.  A big paycheck is in store!
I worked a 7-hour shift today @ Wonderland, from 2 to 9 in the evening.  I was down at the go-karts for the first 5 hours of my shift before I got a half-hour break.  Then once I clocked back in I had to go down to the shop and make spare tires for another hour before I was finally able to go up front and sit around until my shift got over.  I was thinking about playing poker with some buddies but after running around all day at work, I am pretty exhausted and would much rather call it a night and hit the hay rather than lose some money.  A movie that looks pretty decent is The Manchurian Canidate starring Denzel Washington - might try and go see that tomorrow night.  Tomorrow I'm only working a 5-hour shift from 1 to 6, then Thursday I have the day off as I have an initial exam for orthodontist-related crap.
Work today sucked.  I was scheduled to work from 11 to 4, but I was held for an hour longer as our schedule is always messed up and they needed someone to run the go-karts until another guy came on at 5.  It was only suppose to be in the mid-80s today but it was a lot hotter than that - and humid as hell.  Then we had a duststorm.  At about 6:30 there was a severe thunderstorm warning on all channels - I looked to the south and all you could see was a brown wall.  Once it hit the whole sky turned brown...it lasted for about 45 minutes.  It was pretty o
