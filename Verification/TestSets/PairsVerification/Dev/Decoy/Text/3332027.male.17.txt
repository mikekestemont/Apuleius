I got the new Avril Lavigne album. Not too bad at all. Her first album was so much more better, but will take it. I hope she doesnn't feel the sophmore slump.  It's got 12 tracks and runs for 40 minutes. She's moved away from  Complicated  and  Sk8er boi  to a new edgier sound that reminds you off  Losing Grip . She's probobly number 1 this week. LOL if she does hit number 1, Usher will be back on top! Ya Usher's  Confessions  is the shiet so don't hate on it.  No song or poem it's just an opinion log.  *Final DaY oF the 3 DaY WeEkeND, WhaT DoeS 2DaY HaVe In StoRe 4 mE?*
The nice shiny ecko watch has ticked to 11:41 P.M. I had a the greatest nap ever. I slept from like 2:30 till like 8:05. I was making up lost sleep for the past week and I was exhausted from hanging out yesterday. I dunno why but in my dream, the first week of my relationship with my ex just flashed in front of me, everything we did that first week I saw. In Church, I daydreamed that we was on the ferry and I went overboard...BrB  It's now 12:01 A.M  Hmm...I think my ex just moved on. He's going out with someone tonight and I can't really stop him. Instead of being sad and upset like I use to be, I'm actaully kinda pissed and annoyed. I think i saidd something to soon about doing anything for him. I told him I'd do anything to get him. That maybe be true, but I don't appreciate being tested on that theory. I think he's trying to check me. Chances are, he probobly gonna hit that so...I'll figure it out. I was ready to message my friend and then I noticed her away. (Veena don't kill me please!) It said:   "If you have it [love],  you don't need to have anything else, and if you don't have it, it doesn't matter much what else you have."   In a way, that's true. I got love for my ex, it might not that be that love couples who were married you know 50 years or like our parents love eachother if their still married. But it was love. It wasn't real strong like words can't describe but I love the kid. I guess, I shoulda told him that. But, hey if he wanna go his own, that's his shiet. Guess he moved on, if you move after a month like that, guess it was nothing (or i didnt mean nothing;maybe he had someone else on the side). I understand now.   Ya One Last Thing, that Vader dude, ya he whack. Vader, you bumped your head with that thinking im perverted and stuff. You, of course is the first to notice love. A smart person would have thought: "hmm maybe he ment to say i live on decker ave. not I love on decker ave." Again he musta bumped his head. How does the sprint guy deal with stupidity...(probobly same w
