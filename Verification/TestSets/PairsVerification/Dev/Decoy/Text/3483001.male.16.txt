in ym last writing i saw that i used way too many " i guesses". yea i know, the end of the world right? you know what that's the problem with ppl today. we need to loosen up. everyone's so damn anal about what's going on in the world or whats going on in other people's lives, ( this whole gay marriage thing) when our own shit is fucked up. we're living in messed up times ladies and gents. i mean no one can be themselves without being put into a 'certain' class of people. then those people are put into a sub category and then that sub category is put into an even smaller category, until we're nothing at all. so then what is life, then? NOTHING. there's no such thing as black, white, gay, straight or anything of the such, were nothing at all.                                            ZEN eat your heart out.. HEH HEH
i have no idea why i am doing this, i guess its because you're going outta town so i guess i will use this as a means to keep you updated on the random goings on in my life, seeing as how nothing has happened to me right now, i guess i have nothing more to write. well i guess as a bonus, you, my public get the view it too.heh heh
hello all, did ya miss me? i knew you wouldnt heh. whatever. anyways i hope you all are in good spirits and all that good shit and um yea. so lets see whats been going on in my life that i havent even spilled yet or have just remembered? well let's see. um shit at school is perfectly normal, my mom is still a habitual bitch, and other than that im fine. well other than having a case of "monkee missing" and a chronic case of writer's block im good. so i guess i'll write something longer later.                       heh
ok, to let some of you know, the one known as "frozenmonkee" is my significant other. no, i'm not trying to broadcast my business out in the street, nor am i trying to ward off any potential on-lookers, no its just important to the story, here. and since you all are my adoring public ( shameless plug), and this blog is an open window into my life, i guess i should share 'this' particular chapter with you.   so to catch you all up, frozen and i are practically married, tee hee hee, ok thats enough with the zany laughter, and basically the monkee is leaving me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  no, were not breaking up, asshole. no the monkee is going away to school!!! eh. i think its hella cool because it opens up alot of doors and avenues for me! so for now on, monkee and my public, the future writing's i will have will be without monkee!  let the drama ensue!!! woo hoo!! im hopped up on the goof balls.
Even though its the end of the year my work is just beginning. of course, there are numerous topics on my mind  i
