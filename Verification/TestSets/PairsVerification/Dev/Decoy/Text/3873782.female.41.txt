met lots of nice folks.  I am now getting ready to leave for the weekend, up to Ventura to house sit for some friends, and work their motorcycle training site for them while they're out of town on a vacation to Canada. I'm still trying to figure out how it can be ME that's vacationing, and someone else stays behind and does my work for me. Time to buy another Lotto I guess.  Oh, I don't want to end this on a bad note, but I have a sad story: Some friends of mine came by last nite to report that their young, strong, range-raised BLM-rescue Mustang died yesterday of West Nile virus. It's out there, so beware. The sad thing is that they think it was complicated by the innoculation they gave it, that somehow Nugget already had the virus and was fighting it off naturally, and the shot elevated the exposure to a level he couldn't handle. So use lots of Off when you're out in the evenings, clear out your standing water, and ... I don't know what else. Hope for the best, I guess. Send your good thoughts to Larry and Jeri, they're feeling pretty low.
you know what's funny... after spending another 1/2 hour or so on that last post, I just hit the "publish" button without thinking. Fortunately it went through this time! Got one past the 'hoonies!  Hahahahahah!  NO I DIDN'T!!  This p.s. was kicked back off!!   hahahah!  the Manihoonies are alive and well...!!  (or maybe it was Nugget?!!)
I have set my alarm and gotten up at 5 something most of this week.  Now I am looking forward to Monday, which I have off, and guess what time I will set my alarm?!  O-Dark-Thirty again.  Cruel.  But this time it is for personal reasons, a golf tourney!  When I get up early because I have to, I often muse how nice it would be to reap the benefit of the cool, the prospect and potential of a full day available if I was to be up this early on a day I DIDN't have to.  So I have that to look forward to, to see if my musings are warranted.  While I am a little disappointed that I am giving up my leisurely morning tomorrow, the true decadence of sleeping until I can't sleep anymore, I will trade that tonite for an equally fulfilling thing:  to go to bed really really early.  In fact, it's not even dark out yet.  Now THAT feels like a really guilty pleasure!  As you may surmise,  one of my most favorite things to do is sleep.  I loves me my sleep.  It's one of the things I do best, and one of the things that puts me at odds if I miss it, even if it's just a couple of hours short of my requisit 9 or 10.    So with that, I bid thee adieu, I have a pillow with my name ALL over it!  Sweet dreams to all, I will write again with news of the tourney!  G
