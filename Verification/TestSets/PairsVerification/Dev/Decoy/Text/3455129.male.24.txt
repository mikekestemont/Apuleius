Almost ready to hit the road. For those of you who don't know I am driving down to DC to visit my family and my buddy Jason for the Memorial Day Weekend. It's actually turned into an extended vacation. I got Friday and Tuesday off as well. Less than two months on the job and I'm already relishing the moment.   Oh yes, did I tell you I'm driving down to DC. This will be my second time I'm making the midnight trek. This time with my mom. And we're leaving any moment now...  Home: 11:20 PM ETA DC 8:00 AM   I'll have more stories and pics to share when I'm back.   Hope everyone has a good weekend. Have some BBQ for me. Go Sox!
There is always a give and take going on between my belly and my head.  "Wow, this food is really yummy, I want to eat all of it." "I'm so full, I should save my leftovers for later." The breaking point comes when you eat more than two thirds of your meal and your leftovers become a moot point. I crossed that point just a while back. I am so full right now and I don't want to write any more BzzReports...  The trip to Chinatown with Brendan was lovely and I am very happy with my choice of Hon Sue Fish over rice.
As of Monday May 26 11:52 EST my fantasy baseball team, the  Fraggle Rox , is beating the FayBobsters (a girl guy couple hybrid that is destined to fail, again) 10-0.   Incredible considering I just won my first match up of the season last week. Seven weeks into the season! Mind you, I am  the reigning 2003 BUMLB Fantasy Champion . This is my hobby, my life, my addiction.  p.s. It's a marathon, not a sprint
Brief recap on my "career": I work at  urlLink BzzAgent , a word of mouth advertising agency located in Boston, MA. MORE ON MY JOB LATER My title is Communication Developer (Com Dev). I essentially develop communication (get it, get it) i.e. responding to emails from participants (BzzAgents) in a variety of product campaigns. I do not work in a high stress environment. In fact the casual, low-key atmosphere is one of the highlights of working here.   A few weeks ago we had a meeting to discuss the number of BzzReports that every Com Dev'er has to do. I need to complete between 90-100 reports a day, an average of 13-15 per my eight hour day, seven working, sans lunch break. Today I guess I had my follow-up review and I am clocking in at a blistering 72 a day, just a tad over 10 an hour. Suffice it to say, your humble Quan has not been living up to expectations... sigh
First off, I would like to welcome everyone to my new blog. I plan on using this page as a forum for writing my inner thoughts, personal insight, random shout outs and plugs. While the page may seem to be a bit discombobulated, but please bear with me. T
