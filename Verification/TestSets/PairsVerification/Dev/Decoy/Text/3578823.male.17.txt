I believe I have to energy left...I dunno if it is still there. My neck muscles are sore because of the way I lift my arms with my should while I walk sometimes(partly out of habit, but it makes my neck muscles BULGE), they are gaining the muscle which they lost over the past few months. My arms are kind of sore due to the lifting yesterday. And my legs are sore as freakin' crap! I can't really walk anywhere because they hurt so much. We got to go to our Centers today(A center is a 3-hour class that is kind of like your major for the summer), mine is ThinkQuest, which means I get to make a website with 2 other people, and then submit it for judging, and hope we win something. Although we pretty much got it in the bag, with me on orginization and media, Cirox(Andrew W. Co-Founder of Infinigeeks.com) , and some really lucky guy/girl to do some research(we already have a 5-page research paper on it, so there really isn't a lot to research), it's a gimme. We are going to research Chemical Weapons Disposal, it's a huge local issue here, and a pretty moderate issue internationally. Should be quite interesting. We also got to sign up for our afternoon classes, which I am taking 2 afternoon classes(math and futurebuilding..), and two night classes which I am especially looking forward too(Geology, and Video Production). We get to try out the classes on Thursday, I can't wait. Ah...

I met my counselee group and I'm unsure if I will really be able to befriend them, moreso that they might not want to befriend me. My Tutor Counseler is pretty cool so far, I can already tell that he's going to make my summer better by his attitude. The food here is the same as always, and I've seen a lot of familiar faces, and a lot of new ones. I hope I can meet them all..hehe. And I also got to play Ultimate Frisbee today!!! I *heart* UB.   Word of the day--Bedizen:bih-DY-zuhn:[transitive verb] To dress or adorn in gaudy manner.
