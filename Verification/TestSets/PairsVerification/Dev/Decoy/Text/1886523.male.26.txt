right?  Okay...so where'd I put my screwdriver...ah, here it is. Right under my copy of the REAL season two, episode one script...  ...I'm such a jerk.
Yup, I'm 26 today. Exciting, right?  ... sigh ...
So in all the madness of turning an ancient 26 years-old on Thursday, I decided to honor myself with a little Buzz Rodell Action Figure.    1 - Official  urlLink  O.C.  t-shirt  from FOX 1 - Pair of old blue jeans WITH the red Pumas! 1 - Cell phone for checking in on The Baron 1 - Bottle of delicious syrup for all my waffling needs 1 - The Red Phone that connects DIRECTLY to Josh Scwartz 1 - Picture of a special lady  And don't forget...  1 - Jar of Buzz's dreams...and if you'll notice, it's VERY full!  I should have included a surf board so the Buzz figure could shred some killer waves with the  urlLink PFG figure . I guess I can just cut out another copy of PFG's board.  I just ask that when you cut me out that you don't be too rough. My old bones can't really take all the action they used to.
urlLink     You want it? You got it.  urlLink Click me  for commerical goodness.
So I'm watching  urlLink The Simple Life 2  hour long Season Finale (airing tonight on FOX 9/8c) and there's a GORGEOUS new  O.C.  spot airing during the show. You'll love it, make sure to tune in!
Have I read the first three scripts? True. Did I see episode 201, "The Distance?" True. Is Ben McKenize my best friend?  urlLink Not really  true. Am I a very lucky boy? True.  Am I going to give you some hints today? Very true.  Last Thursday, the video tape stork flew by dropped the first episode of the new season on The Baron's desk. Before he could even say, "I have episode 201," I was standing over him salavating and ready to swipe the tape. The fear in The Baron's eyes was clear as he slowly handed me the tape.  That night, I went home and watched it and even  urlLink abused my power  a little.  So here we are, some  93  days (if my math is right) away from seeing our friends back on national television and I was able to see the first episode. Now before you riot in jealousy, I plan on sharing some things with you.  As always, I will share things in the most cryptic way possible to keep you guessing and to keep my butt covered and out of trouble for possibly revealing too much.  Are you ready? Huh? Are ya? LET'S DANCE!   Peeled oranges wasn't the sign he was looking for. A beard, a tan and a yacht are the equation of success. You can't forget about the water polo team. Summer cleans up to resonate at a higher frequency. Marissa does a little remodeling of her own. Big lies can't last long before they explode even bigger. Summer was gone before summer really started. A two pronged attack leads to a sweet victory. 1622 k
