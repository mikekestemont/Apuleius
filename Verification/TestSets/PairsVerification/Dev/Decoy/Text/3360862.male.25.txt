urlLink Shoppers flock to Midway Wal-Mart opening   Walmart!!!  Cheap products that I need.  As a joke I had overheard, went something like this, "Where else can you go in to buy some laundry detergant and toilet paper and come out with motor oil and a shotgun?"  Awesome.  **** 8 more days until "Riverfest 2004" (aka X-Fest).
urlLink Wolves win 83-80 thriller to set up date with Lakers   They did it!!!  Won Game 7 to go on to the to Conference Finals.    It's been a good time for drinking, although, my diet has failed.  I am determined to lose some weight before July, which is the 1st of 7 weddings I have to attend this summer.  The 1st one, my childhood sweeheart, is marrying an airforce pilot.  I'll never forget the times when we would play "glow-in-the-dark" sticks in my basement.  I love you, Emily.
My sleeping bag is getting aired out (someone borrowed it lately), my tent is ready to go, my cooler needs ice, and my lantern is at my friend's house.  I have to remember my swiss army knife (for creating marshmellow sticks) and my lockpad (to lock up my tent when I go look for Limabean).

(Jerry gives Kramer a "what the h-" glance)  George: I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then as I watched him struggling I reliezed something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!  Jerry: Mammal.  George: Whatever.  Kramer: Well, what did you do next?  George: Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a quark and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!  (George p
