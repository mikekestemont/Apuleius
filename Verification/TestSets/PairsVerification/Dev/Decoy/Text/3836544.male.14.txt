the ultimate pyro holiday!! and im making napalm and lots of other things...just bcause im kool like that. anyways, other than blowing stuff up i cant say im doin too much. im not even too sure if me and friends are gonna blow stuff up together which is pretty bad considering today is the 4th and i still dunno what im doin. oh well i guess.   man, gettin back to joplin shows bme just how boring it really is. i went to see dodgeball 2 times in the 1st 2 days i got back. but thats ok because that movie is one of the best all summer. i think that steffan has gone to see it like 7 times now? not sure exactly i kinda quit trying to keep track of it all. but other than dodgeball i didnt really do much i did see spiderman 2, which was a lot better than i expected. im normally not too crazy about the movies that the critics rate as a "good" movie, only because of what they call "bad" movies. oh well this was kind of an exception to the rule. it was good. but i think that they need to kool it on the comic book based movies. there have been too many of them, and there are more on the way. although, x-men, which is a great comic book, i am really looking forward to. from what my informants say, gambit is in the next one. well im hopin, because gamit is the koolest ever. i mean, he throws flaming cards, you cant get much kooler than that. other good movies comin out, anchorman, alien vs. predator(predator will kick major alien anus), nd im sure there are more but im too tired to think of them all.  a movie to consider would be the evil dead series. they are really awesome. if you like anything having to do with zombies or gore or whatever you are missing out on one of the best movie series of all time. oh yeah, and if you happen to know of any good gory horror films, let me know. i like them, well most of them. so yeah, if youd just do that.  dioko is extremely boring when you o and there arent very many people there. and for those who dont know, dioko(not diokos) is a little coffee shop in joplin. its normally fun when a lot of people are there, otherwise it isnt that great. they have great coffee and smothies though. so if youre in the neighborhood go check it out sometime.  i wanna have a movie thing again soon. i havent had one in like over a month so its definately over due. so those that know what im talkin about we HAVE to schedule one soon.  VERY SOON . yes indeedy jim  well i think thats all i WANT to post in this one. i need sleep i have to get up in 3 hours. and that sucks. oh well, until next time, remember: Never Give Up, Never S
