That is a feeling, blog.  And I feel blog today.  Sweetie is downstairs letting the munchkins run rampant so I can have a few free hours to blog around.  And I'm too blog to blog.  I suppose I could get up and go somewhere but that requires movement below the waist that is not even remotely sexual and I figure "Why bother?".          Ooh!  Brady Bunch is on.  I'm out.
It turns out Ian's little wound was not a bite.  Whew!  How do children get these owies?   So we took the triplets to Lloyds Center for their birthday outing.  They each got a turn to run around the mall as we only brought one stroller.  And we had dinner at Billy Heartbreaks, a Johnny Rocket type 50's diner.  They had so much fun.  Mary and Noah were dancing in their seats.  And they got birthday sundaes, yay!  I even found the Speak and Sing Jeff Wiggles doll.  The ever elusive Jeff.  I truly believe this was the last Jeff in the western hemisphere.  He was tucked way back behind all the other dolls and probably no one bothered to do a complete search.  We searched K-Marts and WalMarts and Toys-R-Us in OR and CA with no luck.  It was like trying to buy Tickle Me Elmo on Christmas Eve a few years ago, non-existent.  And he isn't even the most attractive Wiggle.  I'm not sure why all shelves are devoid of Jeff unless they figured the Jeff demand would be so low that they would only need 1 Jeff to every 20 Anthony and Greg dolls.  And the surplus of Murrays blows my mind.  Murray, again, is not one of the better looking Wiggles.  The doll is kind of freaky looking which might explain so many still on the shelf.  The set is complete and will be unwrapped tomorrow along with Dorothy the Dinosaur.  She sounds like she needs new batteries, kind of dragging.  I sometimes feel like my batteries are running low.  Like now, I'm starting to drag but sweetie still feels the need to shower before bed.  I'll be out before he dries off but that shower is SO important.  I don't know what for.  I won't be awake to enjoy the benefits of a clean Sweetie.  Sheesh!  What is more important, sex once every 2 weeks or those twice daily showers?  Priorities don't seem to match like they used to!
The triplets are 2!  Hooray!  And Ian has a bite mark on his shoulder.  Freaky!  Going to the pediatrician to see if they can discern from whence cometh this mark.  He opened his window, either last night or this morning, so I don't know if something came into his room in the night looking for something to eat or if he just gouged himself with a toy.  Gotta find a way to lock those windows.
Thanks, Sweetie.&nbsp; Oh what a night!&nbsp; Late July&nbsp; in 2000 and 4!&nbsp; Can't wait to see you!          &nbsp;    I wish everyone the kind of night I've just had.&nbsp; When the one you love is a thousand m
