so, we're in louisville, home of the slugger.  last night we played with black cross, which was awesome, and the paulson boys finally got to meet the initial people, the guys who run their label.  andy initial was going to take them out to dinner after the show, so we headed for a burrito place.  then i got a call, the paulson boys were going to meet up with us, because we were in the middle of a three tornado convergance, and no place was open but la bamba, where we were.    then we went to ryan and evan pattersons' place, who play in black cross and breather resist.  they're place is so beautiful.  it's 3 stories, all new, 5 people, and they pay 1200 beans per month.  how incredible is that?  i payed 4000 for 10 people in new brunswick.  holy crap.    everyone here is really nice, and since we're not playing shows for the next few days, i think we're all gearing up for some camping or something.  everyone in the bands seems to be in good spirits, which is always amazing.  being on the road for this long is obviously equally amazing and hard.  the hard parts have been kept to a minimum, so that's cool.  oh yea, yesterday while getting gas, so teenaged kid asked greg if we had played the leonyrd skynard (sp?) concert the previous night.  hmm...maybe we need to work on our image, if that's what we're portraying to middle america.    thanks again to ryan and everyone in kentucky for helping us out and being so amazing. thanks to you for visiting.  please wipe your feet at the door, and make sure you take a cookie on your way out.    lots of love, the python
sorry i don't write in this ever.  its just that i'm very lazy and the rest of my band isn't so they beat me to all the good stories.  lets see...  i drove a lot.  i drove some more.  i slept.  ate some food.  i'm in a band.  we're called out smarting simon.  he we're playing a show tonight in nasvhille at this place called the muse, you should come check us out if you're not doing anything. there is something hilarious about someone being nicknamed the beekeeper.  i have a lot of nicknames but none of them are quite that good. booyah.
Yes.  I think PJ summed things up nicely.  I must say it was very cool that ryan came out to the show.  He's an awesome guy and it was nice to see him again.  We've had our second vehicle problem of this tour, and I must say, I could really do without anymore problems henceforth.  Nonetheless, we popped a new tire on our trailer and made it to Nashville no problem.  The place is cool, but in sort of a weird area.  There are plenty of strip clubs and other "adult" establishments.  There is also some good skating near the place, and I was "tearing it up" the best I could.  Tommorow is a show in Louisville w
