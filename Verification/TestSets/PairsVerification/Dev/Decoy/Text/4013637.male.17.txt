Today right after school, i'd an AGM of the Aquatic Club in my class. It's my last day holding the post as a president in the club for 1 yrs. I was proud of myself because i'd done at least something for the club before i stepped down. I made t-shirt for the club and the last time the t-shirt was made was in the yrs 2000.
