Lisa's Ghazal:&nbsp; Ghazal Roulette in her voice
OK, now that worked, and now I can try posting things. Just as soon as my brain can function on that level--I'm quite burned out on editing right now, pardon me. But I'll talk to you both soon on this here site!
I finally wrote my ghazal!&nbsp;   But first I had to really study this oldest form of poetry.&nbsp; I’m just fascinated by the Ghazal and I have to admit, it has left me  awestruck, just totally dazzled -- &nbsp; incensed ! &nbsp; What made me really understand the Ghazal was this website by  urlLink Andy Weaver , titled “The Bastard Ghazal.”  urlLink http://www.poetics.ca/poetics01/01weaver.html .&nbsp; Please visit this site!&nbsp; This man is amazing in describing ghazals!&nbsp; He created my breakthough in learning!       I will quote Weaver, (in just the parts of site that inspired me):     “The ghazal is an ancient Arabic style of poetry that dates from at least the 7th Century.&nbsp; It is written in couplet stanzas, each of which is self-contained.        &nbsp;    No linear logic, can’t make sense of it!     People often compare the ghazal to the sonnet formally, since they’re both brief “takes” on a situation, usually love.&nbsp; However, the comparison is a pretty poor one, because of  that fundamental aspect of the ghazal: the lack of unity. &nbsp; In other words, each couplet is not only self-contained grammatically; they are also self-contained in terms of ideas, imagery, allusions, etc.&nbsp; There can be no linear narrative or logic, no temporal progression, no contemplation of an incident in order to make sense of it.&nbsp; Instead, the first stanza exists on its own, perfect, complete, self-efficient, and is followed by a group of other perfect, complete, self-efficient stanzas….      Oranges and antelopes     “It is this lack of logical that usually draws readers and poets to the ghazal&nbsp; —  there’s nothing else really like it in English language poetry. &nbsp; A sonnet is like a crown filled with precious jewels all set into an ornate, well wrought crown of beautiful gold.&nbsp; By comparison,  a ghazal would be those same jewels held together by an invisible string.&nbsp;  There’s really no comparison at all.&nbsp; Apples and oranges, the sonnets agree.&nbsp; Oranges and antelopes, the ghazals assent.”
Hi Andrew and Eileen!&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I found where your missing postings were!&nbsp; They were posted under previous postings as "comments" for that posting!&nbsp; Eileen's is under the classroom photo and Andrew's is under comments under his haiku.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  When you want to a new posting, click on "Posting" and check new.&nbsp; Then it will post at the top of the blog.&nbsp; Otherwise, if you click on "comments" under the last posting, it will only show up if we click each posting's comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (This function is good for us to comments on other people's postings -- say Andrew posts a&nbsp;poem, and we&nbsp;want to comment&nbsp;specifically on that poem.)&nbsp;&nbsp; New messages or messages to everyone should be a new posting, which goes to the top of the blog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Has anyone heard from the others?&nbsp; Do they know we've recreated our Spetses i
