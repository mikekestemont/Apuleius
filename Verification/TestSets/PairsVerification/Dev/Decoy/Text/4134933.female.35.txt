It's Monday and I just am having a hell of a time waking up! This weekend, we drove down to Pine Mountain, GA to meet one of my best friends and her family. I haven't seen her in just over a year - when I went down to help her when her baby was born!!! She's grown up! A year old now. Anyway... driving down Friday afternoon and evening, then a full day on Sat., followed by a full day on Sunday and driving home.. well, I'm a bit tired. For those of you who may not know, our "family" vehicle is my F-150 Ext-Cab. It's a 5-speed, no cruise control! And I do the vast majority of driving.  Hubby doesn't drive to suit me most of the time, so I just drive!  LOL Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my truck, but our family has outgrown it for road trips. I rode in the back seat for a few hours... OMG... it's like a freekin CHURCH PEW! Hard as a rock on your butt and the back is straight up! sheesh. Who designed THAT? Heck, I'm thinking we'll get the driver's window on the car fixed (it won't roll up and down) and take it on our next road trip... and it don't have A/C ! Whew.. It was one of the shortest road trips we have taken in a while, but dang, the ride was tragic!  I shouldn't complain. We made it safely. There was a nasty accident on our way home and at least one person didn't make it. Semi, Motorcycle, Jeep, and other vehicles. Not a good combination. So, praise God we made it safely... and I mean that sincerely!  Ok, we went over to the Callaway Gardens. That's a cool place. The butterfly thing was awesome. You go in this glass dome thing and it's HUGE! There are butterflies everywhere! All kinds. They were beautiful! Literally, thousands of them! Of course, bc had to be dragged out kicking and screaming! lol We got to actually see one coming out of its cocoon.  That was neat.   The grounds at this place were absolutely gorgeous!  It was like a little piece of heaven there in the middle of no where.  They have various gardens, some in green houses, some are vegetable gardens (they actually use the veggies at their restaurants) AND, the PBS show "The Victory Garden" is apparently filmed there.  We saw the Victory Garden South, so maybe they have a couple of places they go to to film, but this was definately one of them.  That was neat.    The hotel rooms weren't anything real special considering the price, but it was nice.  The kids actually enjoyed it, I think.  BC did for sure, and GC, well, she seemed to enjoy it.  Having my friend's 15 y/o daughter there too, well that helped too.  Yeah, she's spread them out a bit.  But the older one helps a lot with the baby, so that's good.   I'm sure this seems very chaotic and choppy, but I warned you i
