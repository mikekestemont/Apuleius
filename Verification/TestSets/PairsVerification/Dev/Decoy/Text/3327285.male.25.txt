OK, its the final hour before the end of the work week and a 3-day weekend.  You'd think I would be excited.  Well you're wrong.  This day is going by so slow that I can actually feel myself getting older as each minute passes.  The day started off fine.  The first 2 hours flew by.  But then the hour before lunch basically dragged, knowing full well that I was going to cherish lunchtime.  And from there, this day has just dragged on, kicking and screaming.  And for what?  I don't have any plans.  I'm not going anywhere.  Its not like there is anything for me to be excited about that would make me want to leave.  No, its just the fact that this is the final day before a 3-day weekend.  That's all it really is.  And its pissing me off.  Come on...all you need to do is say 4:00 and I am gone.  Is that so difficult?  For the love of all things small and furry....GET ON WITH IT!!!!
Is anyone actually reading this?  I mean besides those who I asked to read it?  I guess its hard to expect someone to just up and read your blog, especially if no one knows it exists.  Perhaps I should put a counter at the bottom of the page?  Yeah, then I will know just how pathetic I really am because the damn counter will never change.  Sigh.    Anyway, I guess what really tipped off this latest rage is the current state of music.  I just don't understand.  Are there really that many idiots in this world?  I was reading about how experts predict that this season of American Idiot has become the most popular and they expect the finale to be the biggest yet.  Are you serious?  There are really that many retards in the world?  I mean come on, who gets the satisfaction of knowing that glorified karaoke singers are competing for a million-dollar contract and a guaranteed tour?  I certainly don't.  There are many unsigned and struggling bands out there that would kill for the opportunity to even open for an established act, and yet, these darlings of the television are being handed a contract and record with a minimum of going platinum at least twice (well, except for that Justin guy...but seriously, did you expect him to be any good with hair like that and a stupid smirk on his face?) and all they had to do was sing cover tunes for a television audience.  Yeah, real deserving.  And if I have to get into another argument with someone over how "the pressure they suffer is so immense that they deserve to have a record and tour" I am going to go Manson and stab someone in the belly with a fork.  Seriously, who can justify this argument?  Look at the facts:  1.) Kid stands in line for several hours for a chance to "audition" in front of an "expert" panel of "judges". 2.) If the kid can impress a fat, uninspiring album producer, a washed-up, has-been choreographer (
