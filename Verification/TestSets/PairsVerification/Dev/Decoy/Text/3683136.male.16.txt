whatever.  And while I take some solace in this, it also makes me very sad.  Maybe he'll be here next year.  Probably not.  but who knows.  Abrupt change of subject: My dad gave me the infamous "no matter what happens between your mother and I, we'll always love you" speech.  I hate this therapist social worker bullshit.  It's the only thing worse than the two of them fighting.  I talked to my brother about it.  He thinks I should stop giving my dad a hard time about all of this, because he doesn't need that.  But frankly, I think he deserves the hard time that I've been giving him.  My brother didn't have to live through my parents fighting on a pretty much nightly basis.  He didn't have to stay awake because there was no silence.  He didn't have to hear the shrieking and the crying.  None of it.  Here's the fully story on my father.  Apparently, some time ago (pretty long, as in a couple years maybe?) he began an affair with one of the women that worked at his company's travel agency.  They had a long affair.  I read a bunch of their e-mail correspondences and frankly, they disgust me.  He acts like he just doesn't have a wife and kids.  Moreover, he lied about everything to my mother repeatedly, and took a long time to reveal what actually happened.  That is what transpired to the best of my knowledge.  I apologize for any errors.  I've never gotten a straight story from either of my parents.  Back to present tense. Ryan.  Ugh.  My heart is crazy just thinking about him.  Honestly, he's all I've thought about for the last 4 days.  It's really fucking crazy.  I feel psycho.  This is actually somewhat embarassing to write.    But hey, I'll get over it.  -Mike (Who apologizes profusely for the excessive length of this entry)  There's a fine fine line, between a lover, and a friend. and there's a fine fine line. between reality, and pretend.
I LOVE DEBATE! I LOVE DEBATE CAMP!  my time here has been interesting.  My emotions have been all over the place, but for the past couple days I've settled at content (with some time/work related stress).  Events of the past 3 weeks:  My first (personal) encounter with Homophobia: Seungwon Chung is a fucking asshat.  Around the beginning of week 2, I was in the library, and this kid behind me (Seungwon) was talking about some shit, and said some really homophobic shit.  It really upset me, I confronted him about it, he asked if I was gay, I said yes, and then he told me that he was uncomfortable around gay people.  That bothered me... I was really upset for a couple days.  But things are ok, I suppose... this is something I have to learn to deal with.  there's so little significance to everything.  MY HAIR IS FUSCHIA.  IT'S FUCKING PINK. AND I GOT TWO SHIRTS AT GAP THAT ROCK.  YAY.  -Mike  Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know, that something wasn't right h
