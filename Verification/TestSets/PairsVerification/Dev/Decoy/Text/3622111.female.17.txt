Anybody noticed that all three of our usernames begin with an S? Hm. So good to have you guys here (even though, Mary, please post soon. --")  Still missing my book. =( Hm. It's one of my favorite love stories I've read. Alright, so I haven't read  that  many, but it's still one of my faves. It's about a principal's daughter and a troublemaker. Mmmhmmm. How do you guys like love stories anyway?  Hunting ghouls at Gothador. Muahahhaha. I'm almost at level 14. Now my AP regen rate is 18 minutes. Yay. I'm going to get sword of speed and equip myself with it when I'm not hunting. Mmmhmmmm. Yesssss.

We've got a new Team Blog~!!! Yay~! Three cheers for that. ^^  And of course, cheers to me coz I'm the first one to post.  Brief self-intro... silverwhiskers, a.k.a. Colleen, just finished Form 6 and getting into university this September, Computer Engineering. God. What have I gotten myself into. --" Um. We can talk more about that later though.  Guys, do your own self-intro please.  Settled for the Ringlet for now coz I realized that this blog has actually been created by me when I was experimenting with names. Hm. Well, until any of us comes up with a better idea, this is going to be our blog's name for the time being.  Anyway, we're just some friends who do crazy stuff and laugh at the silliest things, and lately watched too many movies together.  Like today, watched Paycheck and a couple of episodes of Friends.  Man, Paycheck is  good . I mean, seriously. The whole concept and just the whole plot! It's excellent! Of course, not to mention the technology stuff, but I'll have to look up myself to see what reverse engineers are... Hmmm...  Hope this blog is going to last. Hehe.
