sucks...&nbsp; a lot. &nbsp;&nbsp;should probably&nbsp;work on that.
Use chilled root beer. If it isn't cold it will melt the ice cream too fast and end up giving you a room temperature, nasty-flavored, funny-colored root beer mess (it will not be cooled by the ice cream as i thought it would). You want the best of both ice cream and root beer but you don't want them blended. It tastes gross.   BTW: I am still pissed at costco for no longer stocking frostie; the best (and cheapest) root beer ever. I know Josh is with me on this one.
today my dad's high school friend (Mark Gordon) and his two daughters (3 and 5) were over at our house. had my camera and the youngest one wanted to take a picture. i gave her the camera and showed her which button to press. she took a picture of me (or the wall, it was iffy considering her skills in aiming the camera). then, holding the camera out she asked me to show her the picture. i was confused. she kept asking to see the picture. then i realized that damn, my camera and i were outdated. she didnt even recognize the non-digital camera. yea i could show her the pictures... in about a week. an hour if i had the money. so yeah... i felt the equivalent of some old person with the youngin' not knowing about the possibility of a non-digital camera instead of them not knowing about records or something. i'm only 16, this isn't supposed to be happening yet.
I tend to be slow to anger. When i get mad or pissed at something it'll slowly build up. This is unfortunate. By the time i'm really angry about some situation everyone else will be moving on and i'll be just ready to say something. Comebacks and retorts always come to me after-the-fact. I'll get worked up and want to yell at someone but if i do i'll sound ridiculous because the whole thing would be coming out late and my off timing would just annoy the person(s).            _______________________  Just trying to peg a name, to that feeling I get when I'm with you.
