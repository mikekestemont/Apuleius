God has regressed me back to a little kid. I can't explain it, but i kinda forgot all the evilness. I did so many indulganced prayers on Holy Thursday, and read the Bible with indulgenced prayers, i honestly think that helped heal me, and now i really don't even think about sex at all.  That SSA has not gone away, but I have changed in my soul to the point where i no longer desire that kind of relationship. I still find myself not attracted to girls but to boys, i could tell when i was watchin some dumb movie i didn't get excited from the girl-guy seens but there was one guy-guy seen, and yeah we'll just say i can say for sure it's still part of me. But there have been no thoughts or ideas from within me at all, my soul has been healed and i simply don't do anything bad like that because that's not what i'm made for and it never even crosses my mind! I honestly have forgotten all of my previous impure thoughts, they're gone! i prolly couldn't even bring em back up if i wanted to! it's sooo great.  it seems like i've been given an oppurtunity to start over, because basically i'm like a pre-puberty completely little kid! My soul rediscovered real innocence i think. It really caught on when i just started watching little kid movies and deciding to dream big and don't let anyone complicate things too much. I still have like knowledge and stuff, which i entrust to the Divine Will, and i read and wanna grow more in wisdom and pray to grow more in grace, but it's all so simple now.  And i wanna tell you, even though it may seem crazy, God seems to have laid out a mission for me in life, and it's Athanasia. Honestly, i don't wanna seek glory or nothing, i'm more scared to do something like this that the world thinks is nuts than anything, but the more I pray the more it seems to be God's will.  Now, with this oppurtunity to start over. I need to mature right this time. I need to get naturally attracted to girls without the use of any lust or nothing. So my prayer is that God fixes my body the way He fixed my soul, and that He sends me the right girl who I can start a family with. And with this dreaming big shooting for the stars attitude He has set me into, that family could be a royal family.  Anyway, God is so good, and anyone struggling with stuff needs to know that. Indulgences seem to be the lost treasure of Catholic Theology, they truly can heal your soul. It's time to be optimistic, dream big and go for it, and remember that it is He who leads me every step of the way.
