Hey there!  Thanks for coming to check out what in the world I may have to say.  I've never done this before so I guess I whould start out with telling you a little bit about myself.  But first I need to give mad props to one of my best friends in the world Courtney Helms.  She rocks pretty dang hard.  Okay, so about me.  I'm a 25 year old editor at a local news station (WVLT Channel 8 for all you k-town locals).  I'm egaged to a fine young woman named Allison Mullins who's life will forever be intertwined with mine on September 10th.  I've gotta go back to work but first I just want to say I'm pretty excited about this whole blogging thing because I've got nothing to say and I can't wait to spill it all over the internet!!  Peace and Love
Okay, I was driving home and I thought about a time when I accidentally hit a guy's golf ball that was playing in a tournament and he got so pissed.  And you know what I realized?  There is nothing in this world that is as funny as a pissed off "serious" golfer.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy going out to the course every now and then and hittin' the ball around, but when people take it a bit it seriously it's just so funny to piss them off.  My favorite is when people shout at Tiger and those guys when they hit and they get so mad.  Tiger whined "someone was screaming when I hit my ball" when that guy yelled "Noonan" and he got so pissed when someone clicked a camera...I SAID CLICKED A CAMERA when he was teeing off.  You don't hear quarterbacks crying "all of those people were screaming when I was trying to complete my pass".  Pro golfers are freaking wusses.  It's a sport that is for rich people and no one but rich people will ever excel in it.  Except for the super tallented.  But only people who can afford to play three or four times a week, and that's impossible if you can afford not to work and still pay for tee times and all that.  Like I said I like casual golfing and what not, but when people take it too seriously, it's time to get out the air horn and piss some people off.  HILARIOUS!!!
There are a multitude of subjects I want to talk about today.&nbsp; Let's start with news of the stupid James Banks.&nbsp; The idiot is driving drunk with an open container.&nbsp; When he gets pulled over and the officer asked him to turn the radio down...he turned it up!!! How stupid can you get.&nbsp; But I've decided that no UT fan can truly pass any judgement on the poor boy.&nbsp; It's your fault he thinks he can do this with impunity.&nbsp; All the screamin' idiots who would sell their wives and daughters for Florida and Alabama tickets have contributed to players thinking they are more than what they are (which is student athletes w
