hello world!!!
Hello to anyone who's reading this. I've been on vacation since Saturday, Dec. 21 and haven't been able to go online since then. It's so hard to find internet connection in the boondoks. Anyway, I've been to Negros Occidental and stayed in a place called Kabankalan and it's really, really... ummm... oriental... no... make that, really, really so far from civilization. Am I making any sense? Whatever. Anyway, that's where I've been and right now I'm in Antipolo although just last night, I was in a ship and was feeling drunk from all the wavering of the ship from the waves. Wooohhh... At least I was still able to top the Karaoke with Puff the Magic Dragon. And I didn't vomit or anything like that even with all the food I ate. :p
Gosh, Jer. This is a blog. Not a chatroom. You know. :p. I think the mandough is the mando u know but I'm not entirely sure. La... As for the members of this not so very secret society considering how it's on the internet and open to all the people out there who knows the address, you can see it on the team button coz I've already made you admin. How's that? And now, you can add people and delete people but just don't delete me, k?
Hey! people please come here!  I'm dying...I'm sick....gaahck! uhhh. Oh pleaaase.  just come here, willya?
Is that "mandough" the mando I know?  Or someone entirely distant from me? Hey, if you're guilty of what you do even if it is wrong, DON'T DO IT!!!!  You'll get into deeper crap.
Omigodessess!!!! What the fork!  Hey, doofuses, tell me who are the members of this unauthorized secret society.  Please?
for the love of Gods!!! I'm in! What the hell... I can't see your pic! And the keyboard's stuck!!
I finally downloaded a pic to the net.   What do  you think? This was so long ago. JS Prom in high school. Soooooo... long ago....
Announcement, Jackylou ( I wonder if I spelled that right ) has won Miss Commerce yesterday and rightly so. She deserved the win. Yesterday was also Christynn's 18th birthday and tomorrow is Christine's 19th birthday. Happy Birthday, you guys!!!
A blog is your own brain on the web. Now someone please answer my Friday question.
what is a  blog ?anyone??
What brings up more guilt? Knowing you are wrong or knowing that other people will think what you did is wrong?
