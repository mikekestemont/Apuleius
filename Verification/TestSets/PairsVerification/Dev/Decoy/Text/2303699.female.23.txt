I had such a great day! This evening was especially great since we went to visit the Zekec family.  Back before Jeremy and I met, he tutored them in Engish.  They really are precious people who came here from Bosnia during the horror that was going on in the 90s.  They aren't Muslim, so I don't really know the extent of their hardship.  I suppose anyone would want to desperately flee a war torn country.  They had a birthday party tonight for Vinkho and it was really fun to sit in a room full of Bosnians while they were all speaking Croatian!  Valeria, the seven-year-old daughter, translated some for us.  She sooo adorable and she loves Jeremy. She runs and jumps in his arms everytime she sees him.  (He'll be a great dad, won't he?)  It really is nice to see them doing well and having more than they would ever have over there.  My heart really goes out to them.  Maybe God has big plans for a future ministry that we can be a part of someday.  Perhaps working with refugees in the country. While we were there I prayed for God to bless them and bring them to the saving grace of knowing Jesus.  I would love to see the Spirit move in their lives.  I feel in my heart that this will happen someday.  Please help us pray for them too.
The best way to have cranberry sauce is cooked in cherry juice.  I think we had just about all you can have for Thanksgiving, but I couldn't stop eating the stinking cranberry sauce.  I had it for breakfast this morning as well.  I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving!
I had to wear my scarf and gloves and leather coat today.  This is the freakiest weather I've ever seen.  At least in PA and NJ you could pretty much expect it to be freeeeeezing after November, but TN is so unpredictable.  Last week it was 75 and last night it was 25.  Our kitties are freezing their little cute butts off.  I bought a basket to put all my books in, but now I don't have the heart to use it since Fiona claimed it as her royal bed.  I put a towel in the bottom, so now at least she'll be warm!  For Phoebe, she sleeps with me. On my back, on my butt, on my stomach, between my knees, between me and Jeremy...anyway she can to snuggle up.  I think it's really adorable.  She's definitely a mommy's girl.  I think it's just because I never turn her down.  No matter what I'm doing--eating, sleeping, studying--she's right there to sit on my lap.  Anyway, I do love the fact that Jeremy radiates heat for my own sake at night.  I don't think he notices that I put my cold feet on his legs while he sleeps (shh).  This morning was painful, though.  I was buried so far under the covers that when Jeremy came in to say goodbye before work, all he could see was my h
