So... Who should we invite?  Should we just invite everyone we know - or should we be mean about it? (I love being mean) We can't have everyone writing - ( then there would be no one left to read )  lol.  I think that we should maybe vote on people... Okay, so lets get some rules here:  [rules are subject to editing] 1. Member should post once a week. 2. Play nice.  [doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4. If two members don't get along - a vote will be held - one might get booted.  ... (this is starting to sound fun...) lol 5. Let's try and invite someone who brings positive energy to the group.  6. Let's invite people that will actually  write .  (I don't know about Jill, but I don't want to go through the trouble of sending them an invite only to have them be quite and never write anything.)  That's all I can think of.  eh.  (don't post a new entry to comment (let's actually use the comments below :P)
i am here now.. where are you two?? haha i am glad that we have this blog together! you guys are great! love you both!
I don't know what this site is going to be used for either but We will put interesting stuff on here. I swear it wont be boring!
Read this story about this  urlLink girl that didn't graduate because of her degrating  speech about her crappy school. .  *giggles*  That sounds like it could happen at Saks..
Yeah, Jill.  My emails finnally were sent from  urlLink Blogger .  I guess they were just having server or mailing problems.  Anyway, I think the title should be renamed - but I can't really think of a name.    I still don't even know what this weblog can be used for...
If only, if only...
**Want to be a member??  Do this.** 1.Make a blogger account. 2.Do a little sumpthin sumpthin with your profile.

[doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4.

Too bad they can't play with us....(even if I do get along with them I can still secretly dislike them very much ahaha!) 6. This is not a personal weblog. [meaning you can't claim it as your own - because it is a group collaboration] H
