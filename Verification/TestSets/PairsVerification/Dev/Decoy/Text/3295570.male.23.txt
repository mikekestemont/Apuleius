she wants to save the whales. Hoping something will get started there, but meh.. optimism is not Clint's major point. Anyway.. that is it for now. Again... comment. Please. I'm desperate.
Gonna attempt to keep a blog. Attempt. Right now, I don't know. I have about five minutes to be out the door. Some first post this is going to be. Ever had a contractor yelling at you to hurry up? I'd rather be getting attacked by rabid wolverines. Is that the right spelling? Anyway...  Looks like some of my friends have lives that aren't going so well. Well, join the club, eh? Looking at their blogs is depressing. It's like reading a tradgedy you missed the first half of. For any of you reading this.. you know who you are. And I know how most of you think. I'm going to lay this straight. STOP BEING SO DAMNED DEPRESSED. Flow with it, baby. Let the bad times roll.  Anyway... that's it for the moment. Update, soon, I'm hoping to manage. (Hahahahah.. got you. No, really, I'll try.) Next time, I'll actually post. I don't think this could classify as a post. Anyway, before Bob the Builder stabs me with a letter opener, I'm gonna go. A big see you later from Vegas.
Too lazy to think of a title. Anyway, about this time I feel it necessary to warn you. Don't see 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The movie sucked. Big time. No realy characters you can cling to and really feel good with, the plotline centers around being whatever it needs to be so the director has an excuse to wipe out landmarks with massive tornadoes, and flooding.  Now, besides that, I have -big- job coming up. May be absent for a long while. This job, while it will be quite difficult, should put a fair amount of money in the bank. And leave some left over to go towards E3 tickets for next year. Hey, when I'm this close to Cali, I'm not going to pass up E3. That would be stupid. But I gotta start my saving up for it now.  Besides that, I feel that I need to relate something. This is my first full summer in Nevada. I came here late last summer, and it was laready cooling down somewhat. Let me just tell you... I am glad beyond reason I have Air Conditioning. I could crack some eggs on the street, and they would be done in less than a minute. It's a wonder car tires aren't suddenly popping from heat expansion. I swear, neither Ohio or Delaware -ever- got this kind of heat. It's going to take getting used to for me. I should've expected it, moving to the middle of a desert...  That's about it for now. Not much. Not too little, either, though. So I'll sign off here, and get back to worshipping the AC. While I do paperwork. Paperwork, fun, yay. I just hope I don't find a lighter, or I may be tempted to start a fire with all that fun p
