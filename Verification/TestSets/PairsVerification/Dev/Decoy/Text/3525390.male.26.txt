thing back to my place via the tube system pissing off as many fellow tube travelers as possible by blocking doors/exit gates/escalators with my boxes. I even managed to knock some poor chap's bag out of the tube door and down the 'mind the gap'-gap to the rails below, he looked angry. Luckily the tube doors shut and tube took off with him in it and me on the platform before he could hit me or throw me onto the third rail. I made tracks before he came back. (I did tell the tube attendant where his bag was). I spent the rest of the weekend drinking blackcurrant juice with lots of ice and trying not to go hyperthermic.
I managed to maim a girl playing softball in Hyde park last night - not intentionally. She was pitching and I was batting. Naturally I wanted to show off my athletic prowess and belted the ball as hard as I could, unfortunately I hit it straight at her and she got sconed squarely on the forearm. I felt terrible especially after the game when she showed me her arm and had the stitches from the ball imprinted on her skin. I told her a least she would have something to remember me by - she didn't seem thrilled about that. In other news I've got reasonably settled into Clapham, although I'm starting to get to know the friendly staff at the Clapham Kebab House a little to well (I've had some mighty fine late night meals there over the past few days). I'm trying to reign in my night outs it's getting a bit out of control, and expensive - planning a quiet evening tonight sitting in the garden reading my book.
I doing my weekly shop in Clapham Sainsburys last night when I ran in a friend of a friend from back home. Very random - this is the third time in the past few months that I've stumbled across someone from back home who is now living in London. Makes you wonder if there is anyone left in New Zealand, I had a vision of  urlLink Christchurch  completely deserted apart from the occasional tumbleweed rolling down the streets.

I moved in to my new flat in Clapham North yesterday. Not the greatest of places but the flatmates seem nice enough and is only a couple of minutes walk to Clapham North tube. Felt terrible all through the move yesterday as I had a goodbye night out in Balham with my old flatmates - I got blind drunk and ended up dancing to funk at the  urlLink Bedford  which is quite possibly the scariest pub in the world. Any illusions I was under that Londeners are sophisticated people were irrevocably shattered that night - I saw one too many sweaty people trying to dance to Abba's 'Dancing Queen'. I finished the night at the house of couple of Australian girls in Tooting drinking Pineapple liqueur on their balcony and listening to Franz Ferdinand. Odd n
