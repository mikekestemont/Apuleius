what I am supposed to be doing...  but no.  Today I decide to do something just slightly not what I should be doing.  So Hello there! This is my blog.  I don't know what it will be, if I will be funny, informative, or a complete waste of time (100 bucks says it will be the last one).  To put my future writings in context for those who don't know anything about me:  Name: Ed Home: Raleigh, NC Age: 24 Marital Status: Single, but hopelessly in love with a girl I have been dating for 6 years.  We'll call her Katie. Occupation: Sales guy for a japanese silica gel maker What the hell is Silica gel: Processed sand - used for humidity control, beer filtration, cosmetic filler, toothpaste filler, paint flatting, plastic property modifier, pharmaceutical raw material, and fodder for dumb white powder jokes. Hobbies: None right now, but I used to play Saxophone, water ski, play Everquest (quit due to sucking my life away).  Now I mostly go to work, travel a lot, and spend my time with Katie.  Oh well, thats it for now.  Will try to keep this up to date and pass it along to friends.
Last week I went to visit a friend in Seattle, WA.  I had a hotel on 3rd st downtown (nothing fancy - as we must always keep our hotels under $100 a night).  We spent the day walking around the city.  Across from the Mariner's stadium was a brewery/pub called Pyramid.  They had an Apricot Wheat that was very good.  That night, after my friend met up with me, we went out to Elliot's (resturaunt on Elliot Bay) and all had a linguine with mussels (caught hours before) and pesto that was very good.  All that you hear about Seattle having great coffee is true... I enjoyed a great latte every morning at the coffee house in the lobby of our hotel.  After 1 day in Seattle, we drove the 3 hours to Vancouver, BC.  It seems that each city you visit has a specific detail that makes it memorable or beautiful... Seattle has the waterfront.  Vancouver had mountains in the distance.  The weather was mild and clear while we were there, so we spent most of our free time walking around.  Vancouver has a large range of mountains about 30 minutes away by car.  Whistler moountain is supposedly some of the best skiing in the world.  I wouldn't know though. Despite several trips to Colorado in the winter, I have yet to go snow skiing.  Canada seems to be a good place to visit based on what I saw.  The prices over there seem equal to what we would have in the US, but when you get home and look at your bank statement, you get a pleasant suprise.  The currency exchange basically gives you a 25% discount on everything you bought.  Thats about all I have, nothing terribly interesting happened on that trip, just a standard business trip to a place I have never been to.  Until next time... -
