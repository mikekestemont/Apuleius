I have revamped the look of the site. Now it's looking better, in my opinion. I am in the process of auditing the rest of the site to see if anything else needs to be changed.
As it turns out, Tiger preview would not install on either my PowerBook or PowerMac. As soon as the machines booted from the install DVD, a massive kernel panic occurred, rendering the entire process unsalvagable. I guess those promised Tiger screenshots and reviews will not be coming as planned. What a bummer. Also, I intended to post pictures of my new iPod, but the pictures came out looking absolutely fantastically shitty. I will take some more sometime later and post them.
This just in, courtesy of Mr. Phil Bertrand:  At Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a set square, a slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.  "Al-gebra is a fearsome cult," Ashcroft said. "They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and '!  y'  and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.  When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes."
Finally, Apple has introduced the 4th generation iPod. I have opined before on what Apple should do to improve the little wonder, and for the most part, my prayers have been answered.  I have mentioned that iPod must significantly increase its battery life. Eight hours is not enough, and I said I would prefer 16 hours on a single charge. Well, the new iPod has a 12 hour battery life, some four hours less than my preference, but it is good enough nonetheless. Also, a major feature I wished for was the click-wheel, as found on iPod Minis. Apple apparently thought it was a good idea as well and had integrated this control interface into the new iPod. Now with the click wheel, I am able to operate iPod in my pocket without looking at the unit. Also, the click-wheel provides physical feedback on actions performed, and this is always nicer than having to fiddle with non-mechanical touch sensitive buttons that are naturally deficient at communicating with the user.   The new iPod is slightly smaller than its older siblings. Although the reduction in dimensions and weight is somewhat negligible, it is nevertheless a welcome touch. All things electronics have a tendency to shrink in s
