will allow time to teach me what I have to learn.  For the friends that I have and cherish, until we ever grow apart, I thank you for all the comforting times and truth that was shared.  For all the 'friends' that think they have the right to laugh and condemn me for their own expanse, go fuck a tiny spider.  To the only special person in my life, thank you for being there. You've helped me see things in me, that nobody else realised existed. You've been proud of me and all my tiny achievements. And you've never once willfully be mean to me, just so that you can hurt me. You've been there when I am at my weakest, and you've never left even after seeing everything, after knowing everything. I love you for everything that you are.
My Vooty's comp went  kaput  last night. I am using my beautiful bright red baby right now. Red like fire. With orange lights. Totally transparent. Oh yeah baby....fire red...  Unfortunately, the CDROM on my red baby seems to have retired. Now I cannot have my damn GRE software installed. Translating to the fact that I am having problem doing practise test. I hope they have things online for me to do. Have to start searching for it I guess.  Or else, its back to the good ol'fashion way, studying via book.

My back and the neck will feel so hot, like I could almost feel the heat rising. I will be almost hyperventilating and not be able to calm down.   Anybody with any ideas why this is happening?   The feeling is miserable, even if I am so tired from reading, I will not be able to flop over and sleep. Could it truly be due to GRE alone? Or is something wrong with my mental state of health?  Can't say that I am looking forward to bed time anymore. The feeling is just miserable. Every minor things seems magnified by multiples of 10s. Things that never bothered me, either in the day or in the night, seems to be causing me to fret my sleep away.  I really can't say I understand what is wrong. Could it be just due to something as simple as stress? Can this one word - STRESS - cause so much c
