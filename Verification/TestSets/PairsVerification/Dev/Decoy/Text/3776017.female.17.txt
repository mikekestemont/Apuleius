Thanks for visiting, as you've probably noticed the blog on this page is new. Basicaly most people noticed the old one was working pretty badly, features didn't work etc.. so I've tried this new one. Thanks for everyone who E-Mailed me asking when I'd update the blog again, actually didn't think people still read it! Anyway, this is the new blog and I've updated the other pages of the website as well. Its still in a bit of a teething process, so if you find any problems with it please drop me a line from the contact page. Cheers!
Yup, I watch too much Friends. I'm boooooored! So so bored. So so so so so boooooooored! First up, I'd like to apoligise for my (lack of) punctuation in my first entry. Obviously it just wasn't up to standard, and I've been told off about it (*glares*), so I'll only be using my best grammar skills from now on... Hmmm so not much happened today. Had a lie in, took a shower (I'm starting to take them in the morning, like normal people do), then went round to my good friend Gemma's. She lured me round with the offer of fit builder men, but it turned out to be two old, short, fat, balding men, who spent more time drinking tea than they did building the wall *sigh* But it was fun, we had a laugh. I've just finished reading my book, called 'Are you Dave Gorman?'. It was fantabulous (WEEEEEE Slither has just come on the radio!!) to be honest, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. It's about a bloke, Dave, and his mate, Danny, and as the result of a drunken bet they bugger off around the world to find 54 Dave Gormans. It's a true story, and helluva funny, so you should all go read it. NOW! I love this song so much heh. Open day at De Montfort Uni tomorrow. I don't particularly want to go there, but hey, its a day off college. Dunno what I want to do after sixth form really. I think I wanna do some travelling - there's a big cat animal sanctuary in Tampa Bay (USA) that I'd love to volunteer at, but meh, who knows.. I'd rather volunteer doing something I love than make money doing something I hate. But I obviously need money to travel. And then I guess maybe I'd like to do some kind of Animal Science degree at a local college. I dunno really. But then that's limiting me to working with animals all my life, which I'm 99% sure I'm gonna want to do, but I have no way of knowing how I'm gonna feel years down the line. Grr. I have all these ideas floating about in my little Ali brain and it's just too confusing.. LOL you know those crappy adverts you get in the middle of programmes on ITV for like Claims Direct and such like? Well ones just come on and my next-door-but-one neighbour is on it lol. *puts on phoney v
