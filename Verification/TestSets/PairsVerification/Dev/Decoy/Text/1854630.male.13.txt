Oh, and another thing. When I die, I want to be cremated, and for my ashes to be put in a cake.   I'm not sure if I can feel clever for thinking that up, because I think I might have heard that someplace else, but forgot about it, so now I think I thought it up myself.  Well that, and its stupid.
I saw  The Day After Tomorrow.   Good movie. I liked it. Very good special effects.  I'm now a vegetarian.  A few months ago, I discovered  urlLink lifeaftertheoilcrash.net . The site was about a week old, and was very interesting. I read it, and was thoroughly convinced that an Oil Crash would occur in the next couple of years.  For whatever reason, I forgot about it. I don't know why I did, it just didn't seem so important. When I saw this movie, I remembered  urlLink lifeaftertheoilcrash.net , and revisited it, to find that it had grown incredibly.

In other news, Cake's new album,  Pressure Chief  will be released September 7th. Cake rocks, people. Go buy their music.

Its a weird thing about blogging. This whole weekend, in my mind, was just something to write in the blog about. I don't mean that when I got back home (two hours ago or so) I thought, "Wow, this weekend had some great material for the blog." No, while it was happening, I was thinking that I would b
