heavyweight brawl."  The nature of The Creator is unknowable.  The true Religion is that which inspires people to behave lovingly (creatively) towards all other beings.  Simple.
Okay...so one reader asked (yes, it was my husband): If a shark ate one of the zombies that fell in the ocean, would the shark itself turn into a zombie?  Answer: I don't know and it doesn't matter. Unless the sharks learn to fly like those fish in the movie "Pirhana! Part Two: The Spawning" (which is a truly great film, by the way.)   Anyway, stop and think about the defining characteristics of a zombie (besides it being dead, I mean): It's relentless and without conscience. And the defining characteristics of a shark....?  Uh huh. Now you get it. How would you even be able to tell the difference between a live shark and a zombie shark? (Except for the chunks of dead shark-meat that would occasionally fall off the zombie shark as it swam around... I wonder if a zombie shark would eat its own shark-meat chunks....? hm...)
Do you ever wonder how long it would take a zombie to decompose to the point where it'd no longer be able to walk around menacingly? I figure the rate of decomposition will vary depending upon general climactic conditions. A jungle-zombie wouldn't last long at all. Before you could even say "Yuck! Get out of here!" it would already have decomposed into a disgusting stinky puddle of zombie-goo. One place you absolutely would NOT want to be during a zombie invasion would be a desert climate. In arid conditions a zombie would just dry up and get really tough on the outside. A tough zombie is a dangerous zombie.  Do you ever think about what kinds of strategies would work best for getting rid of zombies? In British zombie books (the one's I've read at least), they never seem to think of simply shoving the zombies off a high cliff into the ocean. Why is that? They're on an  island , for Pete's sake! Many zombie stories mention that the zombies are particularly attracted by sounds, so here's what you do. You set up a very loudly amplified boom box right next to the cliff where you and your zombie-hunter pals are waiting. As the zombies approach the cliff, you simply shove them off with a long stick. It shouldn't be a  pointy  stick because that could just go right through a particularly ripe zombie. You need a long pole with a flat board of some kind nailed on the end. A zombie-shover. Or...how about this. You find a nice OLD barn filled with dry DRY straw. Douse liberally with gasoline. You rig up the loud boom-box on a cable so it would be up too high for the zombies to reach. Wait for many many zombies to gather inside barn. Light the match. Poof! (More like KA-BOOM!...but you get the picture.)  See...the reason  I  will survive a zombie invasion and you won't is because I actually spend time thinking about these things. It's good to be p
