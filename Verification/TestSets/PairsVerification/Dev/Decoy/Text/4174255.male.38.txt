would much rather be out mowing and just doing yard work. The flowers are all in bloom and the dahlias are in full bloom now in the fields. People are starting to drive by the house now to look at the fields and walk through them. Traffic will soon be very busy here in the coming weeks.  I am feeling better after my knee surgery and the P T is working. I have been overdoing it again and I feel every pain I have in my knee today. I am thinking of not going to the advanced P T class on Monday, but rather going to the beginners class again for just one more week. I am bending my leg allot better now and the pain is really getting better. I should be moving up to a cane sometime next week and stop using the crutches. I stopped using the walker last week and was so happy to fold it up and put it away. I know it has only been 3 weeks, but, sometimes it feels like it's been a month. I still have not been able to sleep at night. I am getting up 4-6 times a night, but, the doctor says that will go away. Sometimes it takes up to 6-8 weeks for that to go away.   AAAAAGGGGHHHHHH

urlLink    Stan is having to take care of the yard work and, as you can see, He is not the least bit happy!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    HOME!!!!!!! I came home on Thursday, July 22nd. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is how it looked after the bandages and tube came off. The bruise ended up spreading all the way to my ankle!  urlLink
urlLink    This is the machine I had to be in for six hours a day. It slowly moves your knee back and forth to keep the joint from freezing up.  urlLink
urlLink    The very next day they had me walking. It hurt so much, but, I was told I walked allot more than anyone else does the day after knee surgery. &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is what my Knee looked like after surgery. I had a tube going into my knee draining the blood and fluid out. I hated this thing. Just seemed I was loosing allot of blood, so the nurse hid it from me so I would stop worrying about it.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Well, I made it through surgery and my leg was still there! This was my first nurse, I don't remember her name. The look in my eyes says it all........ &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Stan was there to help keep me from going off the deep end. As a matter of fact, He is always there to keep me from going off the deep end..... Thank you!&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Hailie was trying to help make me feel better. I think one day she's going to be a nurse! She is so good at helping others when they are in need!  urlLink
