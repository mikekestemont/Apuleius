poor perhaps has it's benefits. So my creative writing class is on, and I'm getting kind of excited about it, if you can believe that. It's at my old suck ass college, but online. I'm just hoping that it will be enlightening rather than restricting. Unfortunately, schools tend to make me want to collapse inward, like a creative sinkhole if you will, rather than it's supposed intention of drawing out.  My feeling are so unstable I don't know where to turn. Inside I hear "You're a poet! Write!" but in reality (whatever that may be) the concrete manifestations of all that swimming around in my head becomes too painful to let go. Writing occurs when I have no choice. The words fall over me in an avalanche, so bitingly cold, it's on fire. A pen saves me from drowning icy flames.
Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto does things to me. We have a relationship. Maybe it's unnatural for a person to have a connection to a composition, but every time I listen to it, I feel as if my soul has been laid bare. My life is in a key of C minor.  Coincidentally, as I found out a few years back, Rachmaninov finished his famous concerto on the same day I was born...79 years before that is. I'm not trying to sound arrogant, although maybe I am. Time plays with us. An overlapping of notes and flesh, billows forward into who knows when. Your keys sound death-in-life through my pathless land. You also make me far too melodramatic, so that I write really stupid entries in my blog.  So anyway, I found this new (meaning new to  me )   recording of said concerto by Sviatoslav Richter and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. It's blowing me away. I love you Ashkenazy, and whoever performed the 2nd at the Royal Albert Hall back in November, as I cannot take the time to get out my programme, but compared to this guy - you suck. Anyone who loves the "Rach" should definitely obtain a copy of  urlLink this recording .
Right now I'm looking out the window as the rain falls. It's so peaceful, but not conductive to doing anything remotely  constructive.  I have this "should do" list in my head that has yet to find it's way to paper. I'm so horrible at organizing my time properly. I tend to follow my moods rather than any certain timetable, which leads me pretty much no where if my mood and what I need to do don't agree with one another.      I actually did end up getting Japanese food last night. The bagel rolls are my favorite, although I guess I should branch out and get something more exotic (meaning tuna instead of salmon, if it has legs I don't eat it hahahaha). I'm convinced that there is something terribly addicting in the mix of soy, wasabi and ginger. It's got to be some kind of drug.      Feeling dense today...not very bright - kind of lethargic. This means that I should definitely get started on my laundry. :
