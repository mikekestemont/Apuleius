urlLink English as she is spoke: Introduction  is a web site about English written by Portueguese person who learned English using a Portuguese to French dictionary and a French to English phrasebook.  Its funny.  I hope you enjoy it.
I work up before 7:00 this morning to drive John to work.  As I dropped him off, his manager ran out the door to greet him and then waved to me.  I stuck my head out the window and she responded that she thought I was "John's handsome father."  Keep in mind that this woman is at least fifty and my dad is -- well he's my dad!  I got an Egg McMuffin there and it was pretty good.  However, the man who served me called me "sir" way too much.  It was kind of freaky.  On the way home, the incredibly stupid Nancy Hall on Q105 mentioned this web site below:  urlLink Pardon Martha Stewart Petition   I signed it and you should too!  However, she said President Bush would be too busy to look at it because of everything else he's doing.  But stupid Nancy doesn't realize that the President only signs a pardon; people who work for him do the work.  I have to go get ready for work.  I'm working 9 to 5 and then 6 to 8.  Before work, though, I have to return stuff to the hardware store in Mystic.  Maybe tonite I'll watch Gladiator chez Corey.
I want Gmail but I can't have it!  How can this be fair?!!!   urlLink Welcome to Gmail
The site mentioned in the previous entry is now located at  urlLink http://ontoponline.blogspot.com/ .&nbsp; But it is the same site, just with a different name and URL.  I am so lame.
You really need to check out Corey and my joint effort at entertainment/debate/etcetera at the link below:   urlLink Point. Counterpoint. No Point at All.    I'm sure you'll like it be sure to stop by often!
My eagle scout project is going along very well, but is taking a bit longer than I expected thus far.&nbsp; The painting process is a bit slow because we always have to wait for the paint to dry, the walls are wierd (concrete), and because the ceilings are so high.  Today will be the last day of painting (starting @ 11:00) and then all I'll have to do is put in the countertop (next Tuesday) and have everything tidied up and organized (hopefully Wednesday).  Thanks to everyone who has helped me out so far and if you, the reader, would like to help feel free to get in touch with me and we can plan something out.  I've gotta go do some chores and get ready for the project.&nbsp; I'll write again soon.
urlLink OUTFOXED: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism    Isn't it ironic that the plain old Fox channel is so crazy and "Liberal" yet Fox News is so conservative?
