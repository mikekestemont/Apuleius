then I had cheer practice, it was kind of frustrating because I did not go to cheer camp, I had better opportunities called college and I missed out on alot. So I am far behind and it is frustrating, but I will buck up and take it as usual. I cannot wait until the first game, I hope to be a flyer so bad.  Ha random thought, the only one who got anything at camp was Andrew and his fab first kiss.  Lucky Basterd.  I saw an old friend/ fling today. I told him about my cheerleading car wash cause his friend Danny was there and he came once and had his car cleaned. First thing out of their mouth? " You should car wash in Bikini's, you would make more money!" Men...pshhh  It was cool to see and old friend though, hope he is doing well. He has great potential as a artist and has a beautiful mind, but I feel as if he wastes it sometimes. But what is a waste if you are having fun? I guess it makes that person happy, so it can't be a waste right. It's hard to put a defination on a waste.  Well I am going to go chat w/ my fab friend Nate, wait for my CD to finish burning, and then vacate to my room to learn my new cheers and GUH do laundry. ~Toodles~ Shanny
So today I went shopping. I got 2 cute new shirts, tons of new earrings, some pants, a new address book, and some makeup. Also this cute little store asked me to model for them...no joke! They said they will call me 5 days before the show, they will fit me, then 5 days later I come back, model, get 30% of the entire store and get to keep what outfits I model. Isn't that neat-o-? My mom is very excited, she has wanted me to model for years, she got me a modeling gig 6 months ago, but it just wasn't my thing, I am not into fitting a certain look or style or weight. Also I dont like having a job based on my beauty, I would want one for brains or brawn. But hey, it makes my mom happy, I get free clothes, what could one show hurt right? I cannot wait for school, I know once it actually comes, I will hate it, but for now I am in mass anticipation. Cheerleading, debate, and class ruling sounds pretty good to me. I just got my uniform and I cannot wait for the first football game when I get to just scream and yell and do what I do best, be loud, obnoxious, athletic and peppy. Whoop Whoop...party over here! ( aww... I miss Nicole and Kelsey's Dances!) Then my mass improvement in debate will make my confidence at speech tourney's rise and things should just be overall super. But I am going to go to bed and email everyone my new blog. I have cheer practice tomorrow and I need S
