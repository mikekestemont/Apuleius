BYTE debate was, "We're just here to legalize pot, man",  I have decided on, THE GREEN PARTAY.  That's right, I am voting for a bike mechanic.  Hey, If a drug-dealing, truck-driving, Watson Lake-living, right wing wacko can be elected Premier, why not?    Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay
Good Evening,  I decided that because you devoted readers spend way too much time on the internet and not enough time watching CBC I am going to include daily headlines on my site.  These can be viewed by scrolling down just a little farther.  Ahh the miracles of modern technology, where any old guy can pretend he's doing the public a favor by creating the headlines, when all it actually took was a copy here and a paste there.  Now on to the latest election news.  As many of you know,Jack Layton is the leader of the New Democratic Party.  What many of you don't know is that Canadians don't traditionally support political figures with facial hair.  Well, Jack Layton has decided to defy tradition which, as we know from social studies, socialists do best.  He has kept his moustache   and is the first political figure to do so since that memorable summer where Pierre Elliot Trudeau grew a beard.  While I support the change, I myself am growing a hefty red beard, I do not agree with his choice of moustache.  It is of the small, wimpy variety, with little to no clout.  Come on  urlLink Jack  get yourself something manly,  urlLink like this  or maybe  urlLink this one .  Yar, that's manly.  Anyway, good luck to you and your beard, may it bring you many more votes and may it kick Stephen Harper in the balls.  Sincerely,  Sandy Mackay
Good Evening,  Today, the world commemorates the fifteenth anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square.  In 1989 student protestors took to the streets to fight the Chinese government.  The unarmed supporters of democracy were performing a peaceful demonstration.  Chinese forces  were sent to disperse the protestors, and when they would not leave they were shot and killed.  The Chinese government has never released official numbers, but it was believed the death toll was over 100.  One brave student stood up to the tanks and the  urlLink photograph  has embodied the spirit of the Chinese rebellions.  But, here in North America, we watch our hockey and eat our fast food, blissfully ignorant of the situation around the world.  We do not know how good we have it here.  I know I am starting to sound like Mr. Sullivan, but we were not shot at on the way to school today.  We did not have to fend off a barrage of racial insults while walking down the street.  We are not shot for standing up for what we believe in.  We are extremely lucky.  We must stand up and get involved to keep our country the way it is and improve the lives of those living in other countries.  If we don't, then the bleak picture painted by Mr. Sullivan might not be too far off.  Sincerely,  Sandy M
