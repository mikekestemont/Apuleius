urlLink    For those that have read further down into my blog, you'll understand why this is so ironic! Thanks Google for making me sadder about not going to SCI!!   Posted by  urlLink Hello
Hello.. I've been quite depressed lately, and I have no idea really why. I guess that's the downfall of being a woman. Sometimes you get really depressed or really happy, and there's no explanation as to why you're so up or down. Well, boys and girls, I hate it! So here's what's been going on in my life: Friday morning my mom dropped my kitten Stitch, and Cat Sibby off to the vet, and later on that day I called in to check on them, and my favorite nurse is joking about how badly she wants my kitten. Well, At first I'm really excited because no matter how much I love my kitty, we've just got way to many animals. GC's friend was moving out of state and left us Stitch, and we--especially me--fell deeply in love with Stitch. But GC has been complaining that 3 cats and a dog is too much work, and even though I cant even think of parting with any of them, He is right. I have to make a compromise though. We cant give away Sprite, nor Harrah. Harrah has only been with us 7 months, but this baby is my angel. I love her and Sprite with my whole heart and soul. I feel such a connection with them both. I think GC is going to keep Sibby, his baby.  So anyways, Here comes the most perfect opportunity for Stitch. CJ is the director of the vet office, and she is truly the only person I'd trust whole-heartedly giving Stitch to. She has showed so much love to me and my babies for years, and I know that if she takes stitch, it will be the best thing for her and him. Me and GC have talked, and we've decided we'll give Stitch to her. Now, I just have to keep my broken heart from spilling into too many tears when I say goodbye or I'll keep him, possibly make things harder on GC, and take away Stitch's one REALLY great chance for a truly, good home. My poor Sibby, Sprite and Harrah the most, are gonna miss him terribly. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.. Or atleast that's what I'm telling myself to try to keep my emotions from taking over.. The worst thing, last night he curled up on my neck while I was asleep, he put his little head on my face and slept with me a long time. He made me feel so loved, and I guess he made me feel like the right thing is to give CJ the little kitty she now loves as much as we do.  Now I have to go before I start to cry. Too late..
urlLink    I was bored, so I decided--for your entertainment only--that I'd draw how my tummy feels! Bet my poor GC feels t
