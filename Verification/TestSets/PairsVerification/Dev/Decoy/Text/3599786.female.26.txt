and when they are changing shifts.  There were cameras and cops on every corner either hootin and holerin or actually working.  It was a bitch to get around and everyone here is actually thinking that they will be hit again.  Guaranteed that they would never hit this city again with the amount of military they have just placed in the city.  Look out LA you are about to be blasted into little bits.  They are fucking stupid to think that LA does not need protection.  Fuck the financial buildings, knocking out LAX alone would put our economy to shit.  Here is a cop with sis dog outside the NY stock exchange....     Eh, who cares anyway, I feel safer here.  I will be home soon enough to get Chai and then off again.  Looks like August and September are the months.  Too bad plans did not work out for us the way it was supposed to.  I would have liked to had been going on this vacation with the person whom I planned it with.  I will be leaving for Australia in the second week of September and at the end of August I may be in Cancun while they are filming Gilligan's Island.  Whatever, who comes up with that shit?  We will see about the cancun thing though, it just may too much time away from my dog.  I wonder if the flights are cheaper from Cancun?
Decided that this would be a great part of our trip so we made it last night after dinner in a top rated italian resturant.  Food was amazing and service was on point.  Mama came out to say hello to me and if my meal was "Alright"  She was wonderful.  Too bad we missed Rocco, but ending up with Mike was not such a loss.  I actually made a business connection through him and will be getting a call on Monday for an interview.  Moving right along to the neverending line.  Go here when you have patience and when you want to see the best view at night*****kisses people*****
blow your minds.  I will be devising a plan over the next 4 days before my return to LA.  Not that it matters much but I am already buying furniture and locking myself in on a regular basis.  The uncrazy way yo say the same thing.......You will have to pull me out kicking and screaming to leave this beautiful place only to return to the hell hole we call LA.  The plan will be unbfolded at the end of next week for all fun and entertainment, toon in then.  In the mean time, I am having a remarkable time here in Manhatten.  We spent some time in ChinaTown to shop and in Little Italy to eat.  Here to exactly to eat:    I met an adrable Italian Man with the hardest ass, whom has asked to take me out dancing with him tomorrow night.  I accepted.......ironically though, his name was Leo.......One fucking Leo after another in my life.....Hopefull this one is as gentle as a Leo Lion.  r
