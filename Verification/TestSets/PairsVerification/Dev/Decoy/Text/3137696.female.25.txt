Okay, remember yesterday when I said there weren't that many cicadas here?  Well, God must have been laughing at me the whole time I was bragging on my blog because yesterday afternoon when I took my niece out shopping I was totally almost attacked by these awful bugs!  I can just see it now, God sitting up there laughing at me while I was trying my best to dodge these bugs and not get any on me.  It was so awful I don't think I am ever gonna go out of the house again!  I will stay inside until  urlLink they  go away!
I am not sure if you all know about these lovely little bugs or not.  All I know is that I really don't like them.  In fact, I don't like bugs at all.  Thankfully, they aren't that many of them here, but believe me, there are enough.  If they were any worse I do not think I would be going out much.  Anyway, if you don't know about these little bugs check out this  urlLink site
I thought I would post today about how truly blessed I am.  It has just been a great weekend of blessings for me.    First off, I forgave one of my friends that needed me to forgive him and I realized that I can never stay mad at him. I also realized how truly blessed I am to have him in my life.  Now, if we could just ever meet I would be even more blessed. ;-)  Love ya!   Also, I feel so blessed to have my wonderful family!  I truly do not know where I would be without their love and support.  Sometimes things can get a little crazy with all of the nieces, nephews and sisters here but I still love them just the same!  My family rocks!    Today was just a great end to my wonderful and blessed weekend.  I got to spend time worshipping God today!  I love worshipping God!!  Woo hoo!  I learned in church today what my SHAPE was.  And to think all this time I thought I was just round and plump.  I was totally wrong!  God is so awesome!!   Tonight my friend Amanda and her Mom stopped by for a surprise visit.  It was soo great to see them again.  I have not seen them in what feels like forever.  It was great to see them again!  They need to come back and visit more often.  I love seeing friends again!    I totally had an awesome weekend!  Praise God!!  He is the BEST!
It doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time...  It doesn't take much for me to shed a tear and you have done so many things to make me cry...  I am tired of having a broken heart and crying.  Maybe one day it will change.
Well, today was one of those days that I just felt kind of  BLAH.  I can't really describe the day other than that.  Just BLAH.  That's still how I
