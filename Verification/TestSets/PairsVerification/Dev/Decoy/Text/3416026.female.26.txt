More breaking news from Norway!   urlLink This  is what passes for front page news over there. Clearly people are bored.  Why don't they start a war or something?
There is scant need to editorialize on this little bit of wonder.  Behold:  urlLink  "Usher as Popular as the Beatles."   I have to admit, Usher's voice makes me weak.  It makes me need to take a moment to myself.  He's a teenage punk-ass, but holy shit.  Open your mind and take a listen.  Start  urlLink here .
When I was in high school, every fiber of my being was consumed by trying not to seem like a poser.  A "poser" (at least among the people I knew) was the worst thing you could be.  Looking at major-label music today, and female rock and roll role models for teenage girls, I just want to puke in my pocket.    I really don't think it gets any worse than  urlLink this fake-ass little brat .  I have to hand it to Katie Couric, though: when Avril appeared on the Today Show a couple weeks ago, not only did Katie bring up Avril's wicked-Christian past in Canada, but the fact that not just four-year-olds love Avril, but moms, too! Whee!    Avril looked like she was wishing real bad that she was hard enough to tell Katie to fuck off.  Heh.  The other day I heard Green Day for the first time in years.  And for the first time ever, they sounded punk as fuck to me.  This is even taking into consideration their role in the "Seinfeld" series finale.  I think that's a real testament to what's going on now.    I would also add-- possibly also as a testament to how much time has passed-- that back then, Courtney Love was my idol.  I remember when she and Kurt were featured in Sassy magazine talking about how "zits are beauty marks" and stuff like that. Fucking fabulous.  This was back when she was  urlLink at least more Nancy Spungen  than  urlLink Hollywood freakshow.    Oh well.  And don't even get me started on Fred Durst.
I know this blog is heavy on the anti-Bush stuff, but it's important.    I think   urlLink this op-ed by Bob Herbert in the NY Times  is a really straight-foward, concise piece about Al Gore's recent, amazing, forehead-vein-busting vitriol against this administration.  Although I have to admit that I occasionally have trouble separating the real Al Gore from  urlLink the fake Al Gore .
Sometimes I wish these two words would hold a less prominent position in the vernacular of females age 13-30: 1) random (especially as a noun) 2) drama  Although I was reading the wicked dirty "Tropic of Cancer" and Henry Miller is all, "Things are always happening.  It seems everywhere I go there is drama."    Ha!  Dude.
My alert friend Laura sent me  urlLink this alarming article  from the NY Times today.  Something about it is so icky and sad.  And yet.. and yet..
Here is  urlLink NME's poll results  for all-time faboulousest Pixies song ever.   Not a surprising choice.  At least it wasn't "Hey" though.  A
