I wrote the post below, before this one, originally without the comment at the end about my NiS story. It in fact ended at my statement on the nature of consent.  I added the ending, starting with "One of the key"... based on a reader feedback which seemed to imply that there was a contradiction between my views on consent and my story.  The first thing to say there, which holds for any fiction I write, is that my stories and me are not the same. My views may contradict my fiction, and in fact if one of the stories I am working on manages to stay on track - may even make a point counter to my own views.  The comments were added in this case though, simply to state that I wasn't seeing that same contradiction.   I do see a -LOT- of fiction where the 'moral of story' is about as strong as a Saturday morning cartoon. There is an overriding point being made and every last character either fails or succeeds based on their ability to live up to this point - become a hero if they embrace it or a villain if they reject it. In this sort of 'self-serving idealist fiction' it is almost always the protagonist who forms the hero, and it often seems as if the author is preaching something.  I'm sure I'm guilty of it in some of my work as well. Hopefully less so rather than more so...  But I do struggle to -not- write like that, however it seems readers have grown so used to the style that they often presume the characters and the author are in agreement, and they actively try to seek out not just the point but how it connects to the author.  I've heard it said many times for example, that Steven King is some kind of creep, just look at the horror of his work... Well, he may or may not be a creep - I've never met him, but he is not his work. Even without knowing the first thing about who he actually is, I'm fairly certain I can say that and be correct.  He's not unique in that.  You cannot say though, that it's like saying an actor is not the character they play - because actors aren't the ones creating those characters nor even their lines... But that analogy might help someone to understand what I'm saying.  Who and what I am does come out from time to time in this blog, but the same can only sometimes be said about my fiction.  Is there a point in my fiction, I'm sure there is, and I want a 4 page essay on it turned in by... oh never mind. :) But that point is not necessarily me.
NiS Archive  Yes, I've joined in with keeping the  urlLink Naked in School  archive up to date.  No, I will not be redesigning the site with any fancy whatever... even though, actually, it already has all that... :)  If you have a contribution to t
