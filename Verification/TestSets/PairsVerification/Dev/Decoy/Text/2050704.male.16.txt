myyyy stomach, it hurts! Oh yeah.. la la la la la... that guy kicked me good. Doo doo doo dah dah dah... kicking me, LA LA LA".  Here are some classic one-liners we got from this man:  "Ooooooh... i'm taking the bus, and we're on the road, but i'm not carrying a load!" "You see that sign, it says 'Don't walk in front of the bus', but I don't have a motor!" "Pull the string, pull the lever, gotta stop the bus!"  Of course, as any normal human being would, I spent the rest of the bus ride looking out the window, biting my lip trying not to laugh. I mean, I know it's not the man's fault that he has some mental problem, but how in the heck do these people always manage to find the bus I'M taking, on that same day. I swear, I could go on a trip to Cuba and somehow, if i'm taking a bus, the blueblack pants twins and toothless Pete would all show up too.  Alright, moving along...  Why can't a round of golf be normal for me? Seriously?  OK, flashback a year. Me, Randy, Shawn and my dad are all playing golf. We come to the hole that runs along the road. Randy tees  off and...  *SMACK*  Yup, he hit a car. Did the guy notice? Hm, I dunno... oh look, a man is walking up the fairway now. I wonder if that's him.  "Hey, what the hell you doing hitting my car with a ball *directed at Shawn, who didn't even hit the ball*" "I didn't hit your car, sir" "Oh, don't give me that crap, I saw ya lining up" Randy: I hit a car, yes "Oh, so it was you... what the hell is your problem." My dad: Well, he didn't MEAN to, sir "I don't care if he meant to... God, you're lucky it wasn't my son's Mustang, or he woulda shoved those clubs right up your..."  Yeah, we don't need to continue that story. But really, would that happen to anyone BESIDES us at golf? Oh, I highly doubt it. I mean, this past week, I went out with Shawn and my dad, and Shawn drove a golf ball, into almost NEGATIVE yardage. How is this possible? I mean, this is how it went...  Shawn swings. "What.... the hell.... was that"  Of course me and my drop killed ourselves laughing, but really, it's my curse... I always must bring the most craziest happenings to wherever I am at. In this same round?  A MAN IN HEADPHONES WAS WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FAIRWAY WHEN WE WERE TEEING OFF . What is this guy's problem? Did he spot a quarter from fifty feet out and say "Duuuuh... WOOOOW! A shiny quarter! Duuuuuuuuh... I must get it at once!" Or perhaps he saw a hoola-hoop, and by golly, you can't leave a hoola-hoop just sitting there, right? Of course not! You've gotta run out and go DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF A GOLF BALL.  Man, I love l
