and if the girl comes in, it'll be much more likely.
Wow, everyone's leaving. What the hell man. This aint cool. Everyone's goin' off to college, and getting better lives. I feel like the shithead who gets stuck in the little town and becomes sheriff and does nothing with his life.  Nar's goin' off to CSUN, I offered to drop her at the train station...not drop her, but take her there. She won't have it. Cam's at CC with me, but still, it's like everyone else is leaving. Son is off to Oxy, Lee is goin to some Lutheran type place in Minnesota or something, nothing's clear, everyone's leaving.  Well, that's not true. Not everyone is leaving. Some of the shitty people are sticking around. We call it getting Miked for a reason you know? JoJo is at the CC wit Cam and me, but it seems like the only classes she could have taken are things like Beginner's Photosynthesis Mechanics and shit, you know...the things only three people take becuase they have too.  Ah well. My schedule is fucked over too. Mon.-Thurs. I start at either 7 or 715 depending, and end between 930 and 1030. Damn, it's shorter than virgin sex! Wed. and Fri. I leave at 430 tho, what a bitch. But Friday is my film history day, and Cam and I will never forget the Van when it comes to film history.  We thought about takin english wit Van Leuven over winter, but he teaches 1a, and we've got that covered. It seems like the thing to do tho, just to piss Van off.  Oh well, that's enough for now...but maybe, just maybe I'll have some more for yah in a few minutes; if not, wait 'til tomorrow.
urlLink    I don't think the DJ I thought was the DJ was playin' the music. In fact, I'm quite sure it was someone much more compatible and more challenging. I suppose there's nothing to do except try, so I guess I will. Bonus: she expressed interest. That shit hasn't happened since...yeah.&nbsp; urlLink
We're goin to White Castle! Ok, so we're goin' right, next summer. Cam, and the Nar, and me...maybe some other guys. It was all inspired by "Harold and Kumar..."      One problem. I went to the White Castle website to find the location in Cherry Hill, New Jersey where Harold and Kumar end up, but it wasn't there! There's no White Castle in Cherry Hill! But there are 3 in the general vicinity. Plan: go to each location and take pictures and compare them to the movie. If I have a dvd system in my car though, I won't need to compare really, just drive up and look.      Anyway, we're of to see the Castle, the wonderful Castle of White!
Looks like I'll be getting A S in all my classes, and I'll just fill in the ..shole.      You say you'd fuck her, but you'd probably fight. Just remember, make up sex with a bitch is a bitch.      If you have to ask for help to take an IQ test, just s
