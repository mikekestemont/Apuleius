else.  Everyone should have read nickel and Dimed.  And, although Beth Shulman and not Barbara Ehrenreich wrote it, Betrayal of Work should have also been read.  Powell's or Amazon or even the wise folks at Bookpeople, where my wife works, should be smart enough to bundle these books together.  They go brilliantly together.  Poverty and the working poor is a problem that should concern everyone.  It is very clear that the typical American, with our willingness to shop at Wal-Mart, Target and the like, is not doing enough to help low wage workers.  These stores don't keep the prices low by getting some super secret deals from distributors that aren't available to your local merchants.  They take it out on the wage earners.  They treat their employees as disposable tools.  It's not right or good.  It doesn't help society.  If this is how we keep prices down, maybe the prices need to come up, not because of inflation though.  The government needs to get involved, raise wages, legislate profit sharing.  I'm convinced that wages could go up and prices could stay low if there were some mechanism legislating the distribution of profits between manager and worker.  It makes sense.  All arguments for keeping the minimum wage low is that increases in wages lead to increased unemployment.  That's true, but aren't  executives compensated?  Don't their monies count as wages as well?  Wouldn't an increase in their wages lead to increased unemployment?  If that's the case, then skyrocketing executive pay should be considered a problem for the public good meriting government intervention.  I don't mean to imply that managers and executives don't deserve to be well compensated.  Surely they deserve compensation for their expertise, experience and education.  But, not hundreds of times that of the typical employee.  That's just silly.  That will conclude my partially completed thought.  The first such post in months.
So, I've just moved and regained access to the oh so precious internet.  This is what I have to say about moving across country.  Madison is nice.  One problem, I live down the street from a barbecue place.  Strangely enough, they have a picture of Ruby's in the men's room.  Anyway, every night, close to dinner time, the aroma of smoked meats and barbecue sauce enters my home.  I've wanted barbecue chicken every night that we've been here.  It's too much.  Beyond the smells, it's nice.  I seem to have settled on the fringe of the hispanic part of town, which is nice.  I've already found good mexican food and palettas.  It's nice.
PBR is a serviceable alternative to Lone Star.  That is my conclusion.  It's not as good, but it'll do.  The Capital Amber and Capital Brown are both better than Shiner.  I will miss Zeigenbock.  There is a store here called Woodman's.  It houses more beer than I have ever seen in one place in my life.  It's kind of like a little slice of heaven.  I'm going to struggle to get used to the liquor in the grocery store thing.  That's different than both Fayetteville and Austin.  Be s
