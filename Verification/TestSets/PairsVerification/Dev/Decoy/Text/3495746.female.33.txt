urlLink    Little Angel Me!&nbsp; urlLink
Trying to find out what's my actual url
"We can give you a really good deal... if you sign up by the end of the month..." and bla bla bla. Gym reps from  urlLink fitnessfirst  are as just as pushy & pesty as those  urlLink Insurance agents and Multi-level-marketing  folks when it comes to business -  urlLink I'm sick and tired of them! .   The latest deal offered to me now is part of the Maxis corporate deal, which was better than the IBM one which was offered to me yesterday. I'm two minds about this whole thing, and it seems like the reps are trying to undercut each other all the time. I have 3 reps calling me (one from uptown, and another from KLCC and one more from God-knows-where!).   I already have a lifetime gym membership with martial allied, so... do I need another one? hmmm? So... to gym or not to gym afterall I'm already doing my regular walks at bukit kiara reserved forest and a swim at riana green? Hmmm...?
My car tires screeched as I turned at a sharp bend into the driveway of a restaurant today to pick up a male friend who was stranded by his wife. Yup, last minute calls of such: "Where are you, Angela? Can you do me a favour?" *Sigh* Same old, same old... and I made it to the restaurant in just 15 mins from a usual 25 mins from work. This is not beginning to sound good, "Angie to the rescue"... is beginning to rhyme with "Lassie to the rescue"... snap yer fingers and I'll run to rescue... geez.  This time is almost the worst ever... both the hubby (Y)& wifey (J)went out for a nice lunch together on their day off from work, but ended up having one of the most bitter quarrels ever. When I arrived at the restaurant, I thought Y was about to have a heart attack the moment he got into the car (I swear I've never seen a man so angry before... his hand on his heart and he was breathing like he ran a marathon!).   According to him, they had a major mouth war in the restaurant which was sparked from a simple topic - picking a name for their coming baby... (J's well into her 3rd month pregnancy now)... which led to many other issues of this and that. At one point, she stood up, grabbed the car keys and ran out crying and sped off in the car leaving him in the restaurant. While Y was telling me all these, his phone kept ringing, and I could see that it was J calling and he refused to pick it up. Seems like J's moving out tonight to a hotel, and will be dumping their daughter to her mother's place, while Y's going to pack up all her stuff from the house and place it at the road side because the house is his and he doesn't want her in the house anymore! Tomorrow they'll both be s
