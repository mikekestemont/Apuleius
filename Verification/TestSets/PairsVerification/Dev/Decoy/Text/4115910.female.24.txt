me.        Right now I am somewhat trapped in a very unhappy marriage.  I have slowly surrenderred control of my existence until I have come to this point.  I am not sure how to get it back and I am terrified because I don't know what to do once I do.  What if I fail?  I suppose that is the timeless question that haunts every one of us at some point or another, but regardless, it is paralyzing.  Not to mention, I am stuck in a small two-bit military town that sucks for work and sucks even more for good people to hang out with.  I had a brief fling with another military man/boy a few weeks ago after I realized my marriage was over.  I began sleeping on the couch and I just want that tiny feeling of control and satisfaction that always accompanies sex.  Instead it made me feel even more out of control and worthless and all those other fun feelings when it ended.  Even in looking back I'm only sorry it ended the way it did... I wish I had been the one to grow tired of it first.        I guess in a way I am shutting down emotionally.  I can't handle all that I am feeling right now and I am just tired of trying to sort it all out.  So I'll bottle it all up, become as cynical and hard as I ever was, and deal with it all at my own pace once I have established myself in other realms.  Meaning, once I have work and some idea of how in the hell I am going to get out of this marriage.  Because that's all I really want right now.  To be independent and single.  I mean... there are other things that have to be considered... Some people would call me selfish because I don't appear to be considering my daughter too much in this decision.  All I have to say is, in order to be a good mother, sometimes I have to make decisions for me that may not appear to have much to do with her.  Right now I know I am not providing the kind of care she needs and deserves and is even used to.  I hate the person I have become.  The only way I see to find the me I know I am is to get back out on my own and take control of my life back.        So maybe this is the exploration into that process.  Maybe it's just an online journal for me to vent in.  Whatever.  Either way, in a year, I'd like to look back over it and congratulate myself with how far I have come.  I'd like to think that in a year the overly pink background I chose will reflect a more parallel image of my attitude instead of being the farthest opposite I could find.  If anyone finds me here and follows me through my trials, I hope they like what they see.  If not.. I'm sure they'll drop off eventually a
