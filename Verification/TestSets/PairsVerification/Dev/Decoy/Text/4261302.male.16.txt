I woke up today, not to the sound of wasps but to the smell of smoke. Fire!The house is burning down! The fire has killed everyone but me! But no, builders have started clearing the garden by starting a big bonfire, although how they managed to light a fire with the amount of rain we had today I don't know. Even as I type this, the embers are nowhere near dying. Also, the roof above the bathroom has given in t the rain, flooding the lower area of the bathroom. Not good. So, with the elements attacking everything outside, I wisely decided to stay indoors, where I have food and computers. That's about all for today, because theres only a limited amount of interesting things you can do while sitting on a sofa all day. Tomorrow another post will follow.
I have finally got my PIN for my card, which is a relief. For some reason I have decided not to reveal it to you, so you'll just have to guess. Also the scaffolding for the back of the house has finally gone up, so progress to getting a larger room is being made. It's about time, too. Houses are now being built at the bottom of my extensive garden, and building work on the house needs to resume. Sixth form and GCSE results loom, so I am becoming increasingly twitchy.

I've just watched Die Hard 2, a film worthy of being called so, as John Mclaine (Is that how you spell it?) does indeed appear to be invincible. But it was good anyway, containing just the right amount of explosions and gunfire. I'd like to say that is not everything I look for in a film, ut mostly it is. Anyway, bye for now. Will post again tomorrow.
Aha! The midden has hit the windmill now. "The stubborn twit that never listens to anyone else and just generally blames those around him", i.e. James, who seems to be happy to insult himself by giving himself an accurate reference in his own post. This sprung up in response to an argument that, yes, I started, involving two authors. The reason I started it is because James (Taking note of his self-reference) has said when he brought the book "Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves" by Lynne Truss, that Terry Pratchett, AKA "That prat with the beard" is a terrible author, whereas he is one of the greatest of living novelists. Call it obsessed if you want, but a novelist that has reached double best-seller figures in double figure languages is not going to do it by being rubbish. Now I have read an excerpt from Lynne Truss's book, and I have quickly concluded that, mildly humerous a
