Well here's my random thought of the day.  Colette a few days ago asked me if on the first day of school last year I wore green pants and a purple velvety shirt. She really believes that. No. No. And no way I would wear that, even with the poor dress sense I had back then (and it was poor: I looked a lot like my sister. Sweatpants and sweaters with ugly sweatervests over the top...) But that just got me thinking about how much what I wear affects what people think of me. I have "homeschooler clothes" that people don't care for if I try to wear them.  Like the other day. I wore this smithsodian tshirt from when I was like eight... It has a space suit with all the names of the space suit parts written on it. No one liked that shirt, but I don't see what's so different from wearing a power rangers or strawberry shortcake shirt from when you were little. I just read books instead of watching TV.  I'm lucky I ended up with the group of friends I have (and yes, this is pertinatant) because people really judge you for what your wearing the first week or so. I could have ended up with some bad people... and then I most likely wouldn't have come back this year.  And if I hadn't come back this year, I would have given up and been homeschooled for the rest of my high school career. So really, what I wore (purple and green if you want to believe it) the first day of school affected my education for life.  I just got lucky.
Well, school kind of cheered me up. I'm no longer depressed! YAY! I think I caught up with my homework..... or at least I hope I caught up. We'll see. And it's MEA!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so excited about it being a long weekend, you don't even know. I got up at 11:15 today.  I feel homeschooled again... ::sigh::  Speaking of that, I wrote my essay for Communications today. Mr Cleary gave me an extention on my essay, but I had to (wait for it) email it to him today. So yeah, that's what I did this morning/afternoon.  I wrote about going to school.... and it's really really long. But I thought I'd put it in my blog, so here ya go.   Most people can't remember their first day of school. It was just too long ago for their memory to stretch. But I vividly remember that day, perhaps because it was only last year. Before that day I'd been homeschooled and therefore it was a big change to start going to a public school. 	If you're not familiar with it, homeschooling is an educational philosophy where you learn at home. There is a large spectrum as far as where, when, and what you learn. Everyone's different.  	My particular homeschooling experience was fairly relaxed. I didn't just sit and learn all day everyday, studying textbooks and listening to lectures from my mom. That approach, while w
