Not really, but I think I went mildly insane.  You'd think I would have stacks of things to post, and I probably do but at the moment I can't actually remember any of them...  So, it should come to me soon...  Also, I have to get up before 7:00 am tomorrow! Shock horror! Then I get to spend 3 hours on a busload of freaks, and then walk around for a few hours, then another bus trip! Weeeeeee!
urlLink More great advice from Uncle Yerik  Comedic gold.
urlLink This whole craze  is getting kind of freaky.  I am so glad I did it, and my curiosity has been fulfilled. I believe I will suspend again one day, but I have no need to in the near future. When I do suspend again, now I know what the feeling is like, I can concentrate on having fun while in the air!   Meat hooks, skin, and fun are very hard to fit into the same sentence. Erk.
TV Despite being a professinal slob, I have come to hate television. It's all mind numbing and vomit inducing.  So now I have to rely on the Internet for meaningful, useful and informative sensory data. After reading that you are all assured that I am insane.  Of course.
The statue of Liberty is now open for the public again, since the tragic 9/11 bombing.  I didn't even know they closed it. . .
Absolutely brillian top-notch Internet material. Enojy!   urlLink Spiderman Will Make You Gay   urlLink Schfiftyfive   urlLink BangBangBang   urlLink BurgerKing   urlLink Doodoocaca

Last time I asked for a tape to record some  quality  broadcasting, such as  Frasier , all I get is a "Don't we have any other tapes?" Oh, silly me, I asked for a tape WHEN I DIDN'T NEED ONE!!!! Anyway, I endeavoured to find out how long this program was going to go. And in the meantime I thought I might as well transpose some of my indignancy. My answer is "It finishes at 8:30 I think." Thank you so much. And why is the vcr I use being used to record such mindless drivel that would appear on a Sunday night on ABC? Because it's the only one connected to a tv that gets reception. You would think a multi-k dollar home entertainment system would be granted a  humble video cassette recorder  but no. So I'm writing this.  Also, what's the point in notifying which students are the top ten in their year level, without telling them what position? Enough information to exclude and potentially  damage  other students, but not enough to gloat over the other contestants for the fabled  best in the whole god damned year level  position.
