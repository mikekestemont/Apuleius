our whole life is constantly filled with these sickness, and that is the mind. This spposed beautiful creation, is filled with so many gliches, which when I look at them it seems not worth it. I'm an extremely sensitive person, ever since I can remember. As a child I acted how I felt, but oh no that wouldn't work in this world, so I was beaten down, and became cynical. I didn't turn out to be the person I should of been, who I am on the inside. Now I hide who I really am on the inside, so things won't hurt as much. As humans are always trying to get somewhere, are always in motion, in evey sence. This universe is never ending (maybe:) and for it all please let it be ok.
My brain feels blurred. My family and I use to live in a crappy Apt. and the new place we moved into isn't much better, actually it's worse, there's only one bedroom and my brother and I have to share it. So I have very little privacy, the view out the front window is a sign of PETCO (Evil Co.) across a highway. Also everyone in my family is unemployed, that's way were in this situation, there's never been a time in this family when it's been calm or peaceful, ever since I was born it's been insane, and right now till this day it's still crazy. And people may wonder what's wrong with that girl, and judge me, but they have know idea, just as I might not know totally there problems but it's so easy to judge, then I think I don't need you, fuck off. When I wake up in the morning with the numb feeling of shoving down pain of past traumas and pretending to the world that I'm fine, and look out the window I don't have a view of the American dream, I behold the sight of a true America, capitalism and consumer's. But I'm not blaming America because my parents are idiots, ( I just said it to be dramatic:) they fucked up in life and my brother and I had to be subjected to there stupidity, It's a pity. By any means I'm not going to dwell in the past and mess up my own life, the first day we moved in here I made a decision that I'm getting my self out of this hell, and I'm going make it to my dreams, and if my life is ever bad I'll never put another life through it, I'll go down that road on my own, and blame know one. Root for me world, peace out.:)
Life is insane, but you just keep living it, with the good the bad and the ugly.  It could never be the way you'd want it to be, because someone else wouldn't like it,  but it all works anyway, even if  it doesn't work that well. I've been moving recently, (for the millionth time) that's why I haven't posted, But I shall start posting a
