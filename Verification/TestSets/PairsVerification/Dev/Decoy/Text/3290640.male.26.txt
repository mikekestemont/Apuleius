Where do political media and backroom politicos go for their info?  Online!  We live in a digital age, so it's no surprise that millions of people are surfing the internet ever single second.  What's more interesting is how engaged voters have become now that politics has moved online. There is a lot of information out there for anyone whose inclined to find it, by how does a young "generation-next" Canadian really know where to go?  Whether you're seeking the straight up on US politics, or Canadian, there are really just a handful of sites that I would reccomend.  First of off, most Canadian politicos keep abreast of there neighbors to the south, and I won't even start my morning blog until I have read  The Note.  ABC News' Mark Halperin is one of the finist bloggers in political history, and gives a complete daily rundown of what's happening in the world of politics.  No one on the hill (be it Parliament, or Washington DC) blinks until they've read it. It's become a political daily bible in a way, and I would highly reccomend bookmarking it immediatly if you follow US politics.   visit http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/TheNote/TheNote.html    But if it's the Canadian political scene you seek, there's one place that has it all  The Hill Times, a newspaper published weekly in Ottawa, you can also visit it online at    www.thehilltimes.ca    I find it to be an exceptional paper devoted to all things politically Canadian.  Great read, and essential if you want to know what's  really  going on.    I also highly reccomend Dooney's Cafe (   www.dooneyscafe.com   ) for an alternative newssource that fuses both Canadian politics and US politics.  My friend and colleague Mr. Max Fawcett adds a nice touch of wit and intellect on a weekly basis, and generation next politicos from all over will appreciate it.  So with 30 days until E-day in Canada, get on the net for the real deal.  You'll find that surfing is now an information term, and not just a california way of life.
"All great ideas seem dangerous, at first" - Oscar Wilde     Jack Layton's NDP are moving ideas to the forefront.   He's more left than Martin, more right than the Green Party, and his poll numbers, while not leading the pack, are indicative of a leader on the rise.
