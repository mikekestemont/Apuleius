My search for work in the Texas film industry  led me to the door of first-time film producer/director Jesse  Petrick, who put me to work as 1st Camera Assistant on his project,  entitled  urlLink "Heathens" .  On this project I was able to put many of the skills that I have  developed for still photography and commecial video projects  to work. However, when it came down to having the right tool  for the job, I came up short ­ I am not field-equipped with  a corkscrew. Back to the hardware store I go...
Projects left on hold during the film include  two albums for local hip-hop artists, as well as ads and promotional  art for my best clients. My apologies to each of you as I get  back into gear at my desk. Thank you for your patience.
July may see me on the road again for a  couple of weeks, while I toil on a brainchild for indpendent  video producer/documentarian  urlLink David Garrigus  .
Reconstruction of my website will be underway soon, I hope. Registering with a new host has inspired me to pick up where I left off. I have more content and many more samples of new work to post, so stay tuned.

My job uses about five percent of my ability, and it pays just about five percent of what I am accustomed to getting paid, so I can't really complain, unless they ask me to turn up the magic.
Most of my site is now migrated to my new server space. At last attempt, I was unable to update my Blogger blog, so this is a test post.
Hostsave wasted no time, at all in cancelling my account. If only they were so adamant about fixing all of the problems that I had with them, I would not have cancelled the account!
