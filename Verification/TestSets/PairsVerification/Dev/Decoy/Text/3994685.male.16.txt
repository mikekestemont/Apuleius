about it because i really meant to call and talk to kenzie but i totally forgot because i got up at 5pm. had a few "chores" to do and then my mom got home and i had to go get the lawnmower and decided to have spense over for dinner sense i was going over there anyway so then i ate and had to rush off to a play that me kathleen and molly planned on seeing (i only say those three because spense went with keli and other people that wanted to go...didn't) My Fair Lady which is really good and when that got out it was pretty late and i couldn't call her then so all in all it sounds like one big excuse but i really did mean to call so if you ever read this kenzie i'm really sorry.  and if you notice any grammar problems please post a comment and i'll think about reading it because i don't use punctuation and i suck at english but i read damn well.
I do have a soul...it's sad...but i guess I'll get used to it. Also now having a soul I can say this. Well use these lyrics  Artist: Slipknot Album: Iowa Title: People Shit Text: Here we go again, motherfucker  Come on down, and see the idiot right here Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care What's the matter with calamity anyway? Right? Get the fuck outta my face Understand that i can't feel anything It isn't like i wanna sift through the decay I feel like a wound, like a got a fuckin' Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead  One more time, motherfucker Everybody hates me now, so fuck it Blood's on my face and my hands, and i Don't know why im not afraid to cry But thats none of your business Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it? Spin it around so i can spit in its face I wanna leave without a trace Cuz i dont wanna die in this place  People = Shit People = Shit (Whatcha gunna do?) People = Shit (Cuz i am not afraid of you) People = Shit (Im everything you'll never be) People = Shit  It never stops - you cant be everything to everyone Contagion - Im sittin' at the side of satan What do you want from me? They never told me the failure i was meant to be Overdo it - dont tell me you blew it Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it IM - NOT - LIKE - YOU - I - JUST - FUCK - UP C'mon motherfucker everybody has to die  People = Shit People = Shit (Whatcha gunna do) People = Shit (Cause im not afraid of you) People = Shit (Im everything you'll never be) People = Shit  this isn't always true but some times...this song just fucking clicks. anyway I'm gonna leave this at that and post tomorrow...I think I'm gonna use this more than a
