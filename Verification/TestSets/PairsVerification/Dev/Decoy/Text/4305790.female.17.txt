catamaran carrying more than 120 passengers collided with an oil barge. The air pollution index ranges from 70-134, where a scale of 100 was considered high already. Hong Kong's pollution is lying on the extreme end. A number of factors contribute to this bad air phenomenon. Across the border, the number of factories and power plants are increasing each year. Car ownership is intensifying, although liquified petroleum gas has been encouraged. In Hong Kong itself, the territory's largest power supplier, CLP Power, is generating energy for sale to the power-starved mainland. At the same time, it is shifting towards greater use of coal.  Pollution is a social distress, yet people all over the world can't stop its expansion and massive destruction. I want to highlight that pollution is a very serious issue, putting the entire mass of the globe at stake.
1. Only people from NUS are developing it. Where are the NTU and the polytechnic guys?  2. Too many things must work together for it to take off. It can, given time.  3. Where do you get the hydrogen? Electrolysis? Where do you get electricity for electrolysis?  Full articles  urlLink here
When the government must subsidise the green dream, what do you do? Do you scream that that is almost impossible in thirld world countries? To wait for green products (be it electricity or cars) to become commercially competitive will take an awfully long time. So what can you do?  What really shocked me is that Singapore does not make it mandatory for EIA (Environmental Impact Assesment) for developments in her land. Also it has not acceded to Kyoto Protocol due to the its smallness and lack of natural resources to tap on alternatives (such as hydropower or geothermal energy).  Can we circumvent that natural resources lack? How? Must the solution be policy driven like described below?  An extract from New Scientist, July, copied from the Web: (sadly, I have little time to type the full article I photocopied)  "Worldwide total energy is shooting up. But the proportion of electricity produced from renewable sources has fallen from 24 per cent in 1970 to 15 per cent today. It is becoming clear that market-driven policies will not be enough to realise the dream of going green. To make it a reality many governments will have to change their thinking, and make a long term commitment to renewable energy by bringing substantial subsidies and incentives, so says a recent House of Lords report."  This quote is from the same article and is particularly pertinent: "At present, the only way to make most renewable technologies attractive is to subsidise them, though wind power can almost hold its own."Germany has developed a policy that has sent it to the top of the world league table for wind power and now has 40 per cent of the world's entire wind-powered generating capacity.  The success is entirely policy driven says Thomas Johannson, an environmental economist at the University of Lund in Sweden. When you see how much this cost the German economy it is dwarfed by the a
