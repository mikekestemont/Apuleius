She's pretty smart, like her alot, sorry about your rat, Dannika, we'll get ya a new one! Met her in 2nd grade with Kiersten. :)  Annie: I guess she's my friend... Hi, Annie!  Andrea: Known since 3rd grade. Hi, Andrea!  Katie: She's my cousin. Heya, gal! :)  Hannah: Danced with you this year, I'll miss you! :'(  Liz: One of my pals, met her in 1st grade, she's an organized person and is in alot of the same things that I am in, and we both play piano, clarinet, and violin! Gee, Liz, if I played saxophone, and you played electric bass, we'd play all the same things, lol!  Thanks to my guild members, also! You guys are great! :')  My pets: Okay, now I'll tell you about my pets! I have 9, no 8 -cries- Hampton, my hermit crab, I miss you!   Well, here they are.  Pups: My oldest dog. A poodle. She's mean, but not to me! ;) Love ya, Pups!  Lucy: Pups' oldest daughter, one of my BFF's. She's the cutest, smartest, cuddliest puppy on earth, and I love her to pieces! :)  Gabby: Pups' middle daughter, Lucy's younger sister. She's kinda cute, pretty smart, and I love her even if I don't always show it! (Lucy can get jealous.) Love ya, Gabs! ;)  Sissy: Pups' youngest daughter, the baby sister of Lucy and Gabby. She's pretty cute, kinda smart, and I love her even though Lucy's my fav. :)  Snappy: An alligator snapping turtle, thanks Pups for findin' him! He likes huntin' for his food, and it's cool to watch. He likes to eat, swim, kill, hunt, and bask in the sun. Snaps, you ROCK!   Lee: My fishie! He eats alot, he is gettin' big! :3 Love ya!  Kiro: My  other  fishie! He  also  eats alot and is gettin' big! :3 Love ya!  Hyg√ºy: My hermit crab! He just came to me from the mall a few weeks ago, as so did Hampton, who lies in our memories forever. -sniffles-  My hobbies: Okay, now for my hobbies! These are: updating my websites, playing on Neopets.com, RPing with my guilds, messin' around with my computer, chattin', telling guys I don't like to shut up, playin' with my pets, reading, writing, drawing, RPing away from my guilds, and a handful of other things! :)  Sports: I'm not really in any sports except for swimming, archery, and dance. I like to ride my bike, and I wish I had a sword!   Family: Yeah, I have a family. I am an only child. I live with my parents. (Obviously.) I am glad of this, and don't know what I'd do if I had siblings... Probably cry my head off till they were gone, lol!  Okay, that's all there really is to know, hope you enjoyed my article! Drop me a post, maybe we could be friends! ;
