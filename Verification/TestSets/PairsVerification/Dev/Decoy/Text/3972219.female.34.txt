From Roger:  I was, as you know, close to George and have spent much more time with him than any of my other siblings. &nbsp;We spent some 26 years either working together or in close contact when we were not working together.&nbsp; I can't begin to tell you how much I miss him. &nbsp;We talk about him everyday, still using his lines and clich√©s.
I have many memories of my best friend's father. He would sit and listen to stories that Karen and I would tell him even if they lasted hours. I will miss his delicious salads he would make for us on the weekends. I miss his smile...it was the greatest! He was one of the most well loved people that I will ever know. He always treated me like one of his own daughters in his home. I am very lucky to have known George and he will be truly missed by his friends and family.  Patsy
Thanks to all of you who have posted so far, keep them coming!&nbsp; It's been a hard weekend and a rough beginning to the week.&nbsp; After being attacked by divisive words it's easy to think that Satan's had his day, but then you hear the kind words like those Rose shared and you know that Love has the victory!

I met George in Philadelphia in the early 90's through an ad selling airlines tickets. I had no idea that our friendship would endure time and distance. He always treated me with the greatest respect and affection and I thank him for his company and conversation. For some reason we meet people that change the course of our lives. You can never pinpoint the time or place it happens, but it happens. I feel that my friendship with George was just that kind of meeting. We became friends when I was just beginning to find my own direction in life. He advised me and gave me the confidence to be an independent woman and strong in a world far away from my family in Texas. He was like a father to me in many ways. I sought his approval in many things - including boyfriends. The day he and Dave (my husband) met, they immedietly approved of one another! George is one of the most important people in my life. When I think of George I think of sushi (lots of it), good wine, really great fattening salads, 2 hr lunches escaping to Chinatown for dim-sum, martinis, sitting in bars in Philly and wonderful conversations walking around Old City. He helped me dig my car out of the mounds of snow in NJ and worried about my welfare when I thought I had completely failed in life. I think that George knew how much I loved him. I do regret that he didn't meet Olivia (my daughter) in person. He used to say Grandpa George when I talked to him about her. My own family circumstances kept me from visiting anyone but my father in El Paso up until his death this past N
