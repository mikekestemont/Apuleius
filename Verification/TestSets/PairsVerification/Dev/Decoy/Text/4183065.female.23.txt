long time ago. I had forgotten all about and after it had reemerged from the darkness of the "green yarn tub," I got sucked into starting another new project--I am calling it  BIG GREEN SCARF --ohhh..scary.     For my first attempt at cables, I think it is turning out well. The picture is less than stellar (I shrunk it too much exporting it from my iphoto), but its about 6 inches long making it far from done but working up quickly on my broomstick size 15 knitting needles. The actual cable-ing is a little difficult because the yarn is so stiff but its getting easier as the project moves along. I am using the 12 stitch "Giant Cable" pattern from my shiny new vogue knitting reference book.  My Brown Sheep Yarn still has not arrived. I am also waiting on the new Vogue on the go crochet scarves book to arrive. The scarf on the cover is just nifty.     Hopefully, a package will be waiting for me upon my return home this evening or I will have to face  BIG GREEN SCARF  again...
I have a thing for hats--especially hats that resemble other things.  I just came across this hat--Berry Cute by Fiber Trends:  urlLink http://store.nobleknits.com/becuhatbyfit.html   I simply must have it.  Unfortunately I am stuck at work and should really wait until I get home to order it....the unfairness of it all is just striking.   An addendum to my last post (obviously, I am not working at work)--I found another hat that is shaped like a pumpkin--fabulous!   urlLink http://knitting.about.com/library/blpumpkin.htm   I need to start a list of projects I will get around to making...
I am so impatient.&nbsp; I ordered some new bulky Brown Sheep yarn last week to begin the cutest shoulder bag and it has yet to arrive.&nbsp; I am hoping I will come home today and find a big box on my porch but I am trying hard not to hold my breath.      I also had an idea to make a cute felted case in which to carry my digital camera around with me since my lovely dogs have torn the zipper off of my old case. Maybe it will even coordinate with the cute shoulder bag.&nbsp; Geez, this yarn needs to come quickly because my &quot;cute&quot; shoulder bag is quickly becoming a multifaceted project with lots of extras like interior pockets and coordinating camera cases.      I got so little done last night--football and a headache will do that I guess.&nbsp; I was still hopeful and carried my knitting around with me for a few hours but nonetheless, got only one row done on baby Gwen's pink cotton blanket.&nbsp; It is now here at work with me, taunting me.&nbsp; Maybe a bit of my lunch hour will be devoted to it.
just a test to see if i have mastered the posting by email concept.
Well, I sure haven't ever done this before.  I had a website way back in the day--remember when Geocities was the coolest? yeah...way back then.   A blog...a place to air my griefs and hobbies (mainly knitting...)  sounds good :
