a deal.  Wow, the earth changes....what a concept!  But the fact that over only 100 years so many changes have taken place...well, it's worth getting into.  You guys, please respond to this one.  It's important, and we need to move on from the gay marriage and abortion topics.  I think that everyone has said what needs to be said, and it's time for something else.  Later!  Bethany
this place has been inactive for some time... ms. Clark was the first post in a month... wow... not much goin' on. so, how's everybody's summer going? anyone want to share their AP grade.. i got a highly discraceful grade...a 2... =( and i thought i did exceptionally well on the MC and alright on the essays....
Hey students...I am settling in and have already started working.  Next week is my third week at Shorecrest.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing summer but I hope you are still all thinking and learning...there is no evidence of this by looking at our blog...did anyone see Farenheit 9-11...?  My new email address is stephanie.clark@shorelineschools.org.  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test.  Remember it is a difficult test and set up so  only 50% of the students paww with a three or better.  In addition only 8% GET A 5.  Also remember only the top scholars in the nation choose to take these tests...so pat yourself on the back for your effort and the amount you learned despite your score or regroup for a better effort next year.   For those of you who did well  and I am sure some of you did congratulations.  Rob-how is the ASB retreat going?  Enjoy the rest of your summer and I hope to hear from some of you.
I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses.  And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.  I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.  Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!  Thomas Chen
