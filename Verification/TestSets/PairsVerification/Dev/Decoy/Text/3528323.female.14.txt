back to Stockton until July 6. I know those of you with working memories realize I have told you the stuff in this post many times before.   Any ways, I am having as much fun as can be expected. I am gonna watch  Club Dread  in a little while, which looks good. Last night, we saw  Dodgeball , which was really funny. I already saw  The Stepford Wives  and  The Chronicles of Riddick , and I rented  Along Came Polly  and  50 Firs --  Okay, I should save this for my personal blog, so I'm gonna end this before I revert back to 'noob' mode. Um, anyways, I hope your summers are going alright. I have (some) pictures from my little trippy-thingy, so yeah.  That post was horrible.  P.S. I wasn't calling anyone a cupcake when I titled this post. Pet names are for fags, and the line is from  Invader Zim .
Dear Everybody, Hi. I'm leaving for a while. I will be back on July 6. My personal blog should be updated at least a few times during the course of my absence here at SM Kids. Feel free to invite new people while I am gone (as long as they are from Saint Mary's). I am giving you all admin status (at least until I return), so that if something needs to be fixed or you want to invite someone, you can. If I happen to die over my vacation, please put a whoopee cushion under my coffin, so when they lower me down it sounds like...   Any ways, enjoy your time without my constant badgering and sexual innuendo. Love, Pierce I mean fuck you.  P.S. w00t.
Welcome, Molly and Erica.  Well, Erica can't log in really...
Okay, I have added in a tag-board on here. If you guys don't like it, you can either edit it or remove it. Whatever.  I'm not going to make the rules on this one, since this blog doesn't just belong to me.  Also, here is some information:  Tag-Board.com username thing: SMKids Password: I will tell you each personally.  I also set up an email account at Yahoo.com to use as the universal SM Kids blog email address (if you have to sign up for something, like Tag-Boards, this is the email you sign up with if it is going on this blog). The email address is: SMHSKids@yahoo.com (SMKids was taken...) Password: Same as above.  Mmmyep.
Haha, I was right (see first post). At least it spawned a few personal blogs that give me something to read.  The only reason I leave this crap up is in hopes that once school starts, someone will post something...  Wishfull thinking, perhaps.  [too lazy to link image]
School starts for us sophmores on the 18th. Fuck.
A: english B: pe C: religion D: math E: history F: bio G: spanish 2  Everyone that can be honors, is honors except for history.
Post your schedules under comments (this way we don't have to go to fifteen different blogs to get our schedules out there).
Whoo!  I'm back!  Wait....argh! Vacation! Is! Slipping! Away! Nooooo!  W
