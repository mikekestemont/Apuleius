Yes, you're supposed to analyze from "The pastel house by the shore" to the end of the novel.  Please remember to analyze, rather than simply giving your subjective opinion or reaction.  BH
The paper is on the passage that begins with "The pastel house by the shore" and ends with "such fine American beauties."  (last page of the book)  I believe he wants a reflection.
I am not sure if Professor announced the paper topics yet, can someone clarify for me? Thanks... To the groups presentations today.. you guys were great..!!!
I don't quite see how the umbrella as a phallic symbol in this story. Suzy has always felt that Grace and her family had abandoned her, and now, as she is alone facing the rain and the indifferent world, her only protection is the stranger’s umbrella, therefore Suzy suggests the umbrella as a ‘weapon’. She is used to deal with her problems without asking help from her family, or sometimes, she would seek help from men like Damian, Michael,or Caleb. Being a loner in this world, the umbrella is her only shield and self-defense weapon. Therefore, Suzy feels safer after she took the umbrella, and ‘she can leave now, out into the torrential sea where her parents wait’.
Just wanted to know if there were any reactions to my reading of the umbrella passage.  Remember, it's Freud, not me, who says that umbrellas are phallic symbols! (bet you never thought of this, did you?)  Anyways, to recapitulate.  Freud says umbrellas are phalli, and that broken umbrellas are castrated phalli.  Suzy remembers that she has left her umbrella on the train...And when Bob makes the racist mistake of identifying her with Grace, she asks whether she left an umbrella there the other day.  Bob then lets her rummage through the bin where lost umbrellas are kept, and she chooses one, and this becomes "a weapon."  Two points.  First, if umbrellas are phalli, then they imply a connection with the girls' father and, by extension, Korea.  A lost or broken umbrella suggests a broken connection to family and to tradition.  Second, Suzy takes the "all Asian girls look alike" racist assumption of Bob and uses it as "a weapon."  If the broken umbrella suggests a lost tradition and the emasculation of Asian authority, then Suzy's appropriation of an anonymous umbrella and her use of it as a weapon is an affirmation of her identity.

I believe that stereotypes are everywhere and i agree with Professor Huang when he says positive stereotypes can also be looked upon negatively. For instance being a "model minority" is a good thing, looked upon as acculturating easily into the American mainstream, becoming successful easily, yet it is not as easy on the inside as it looks on the outside.
Hi can Heather Bui and Christine contact me sometime about the presentation? email: Anna_Tran@umail.ucsb.edu... thanks
Hi All,  I realized upon reflection that the one paragraph I assigned for the second paper is a bit short, so I've decided to extend the passage to the end of the novel.  So the passage now begins a
