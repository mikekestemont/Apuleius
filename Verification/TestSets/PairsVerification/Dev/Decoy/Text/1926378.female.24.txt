love company! The trip included diving for conch shells, which the boat driver then prepared into conch salad on the beach. I have to admit that I was not skeptical in terms of eating the snack because a shell just doesn't seem, well, alive. We were able to take home the shells and the one we have is pretty smelly.  One good story for Alison: Matt and I were eathing dinner pooliside at some resort when a super friendly cat just sauntered up to our table and sat at my feet for the entire meal. He tried to jump into my lap a few times to snag a bite of my crab legs, but Matt was not a fan. It just sat there and stared at us. Very bizarro to see a cat kickin it at the beach.  So, I'm home...happily remembering all the good times had in these past few weeks and enjoying getting back to my life. It has never felt so good to shower in my own shower, sleep in my own bed, and just live in my apartment. I am starting a new job position today so I can't wait to get to work. More about that later and I will post beach pics soon as well. I'm reading 2 selections from my bachelorette party: The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex and How to Be a Great Lover. So far it's safe to say that I am not failing by these author's standards. In the Guide, the "good girl" is actually typecast as a gingam-wearing, puffy sleeved Laura Ashley dresser! Gads. I'll let you know how they turn out.

The other day on my endless drives around the lovely Marion County I was listening to NPR, because the rest of radio sucks and I heard a very interesting news bite. They stated that Eukenuba had come up with a type of dog food to feed your dog when they are puppies to make them smarter. The point of this is that the leading cause of death for dogs is being put to sleep in a shelter, so Eukenuba is thinking that by having smarter dogs, people will be able to train their dogs eaiser and therefore, not get annoyed with their dogs and give them to shelters.  I have a few problems with this one serious, one not so serious...  First of all, all dogs are trainable and a dog making mistakes is the owners fault. Most dog owners have to spend a lot of time training and playing with their dogs to make sure they are good dogs, not just one time and then give up  Secondly, I wonder would feeding my dog Juno dog food to make her smarter prevent her from doing all of the annoying this dogs do, like rolling in horse poo? I think not! A dog is a dog for a reason, they aren't always the most brillant creatures, but they love us and thats why we love t
