Well, I was just thinking of mortality and the end of our simple lives. Also thinking of the future and what future generations will see. What their lives will be like. Will it be like a science fiction movie? Like will there be no people with glasses or no fat people ( oh god I wish!) and will they ever find a cure for the common cold or will they find a cure for cancer? Will cars change? I also think of how insignifigant my life is in the grand scheme of things like I just try to think of the galaxy and how huge it is and how small we actually are and why the human race even got here. Like I know God created us but it blows my mind when I think about the bigger picture of things and yet we are sooooo small. Like grains of sand in retrospective of the galaxies. We are small but yet we have the fight in us, the passion to live, the love that is in each of us. How our hearts can break and yet the ability to wage war with each other and kill each other in war and abortion. Be so loving yet so destructive at the same time. Man, it blows my mind!!! The future will always be interesting to me, like I think of my parents and that my mom had never gotten a tv till she was 13 and she used to go to sock hops and she listened to Elvis when he first came out, like that blows my mind in itself. So I wonder when our children ask us about Nirvana or September 11th and that there was no computers when we were young.LOL!! Ok enough rambling!!!!XOXOXO

8 tracks!!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
I was just thinking of how music has changed over my lifetime. Like how when I was really young there was records and I listened to the Cabbage Patch Kids records and such and then 8 tracks when I listened to BJ Thomas and Evie in my parents cars (Mercuries) because they actually had 8 track players and then cassettes were huge and I bought a lot of them when I was 10-13 or 14 and then cd's and now the computer age has hit us and now everything is digital and itune players will be had by all so I'm wondering what will be next after this or is this the end of technology(HAHA as if!). SO it'll be exciting to see what happens and the generation gap between me and my parents widen by the years as my mom is completely computer illiterate and she hates computers. But my dad is hip and he gets jiggy with his computer. So it's awesome to see the elders getting into it!!
