The function or purpose of Internet Protocol is to move datagrams through an interconnected set of networks.  This is done by passing the datagrams from one internet module to another until the destination is reached.  The internet modules reside in hosts and gateways in the internet system.  The datagrams are routed from one internet module to another through individual networks based on the interpretation of an internet address.  Thus, one important mechanism of the internet protocol is the internet address.    In the routing of messages from one internet module to another,datagrams may need to traverse a network whose maximum packet size is smaller than the size of the datagram.  To overcome this difficulty, a fragmentation mechanism is provided in the internet protocol.
It sends this datagram and the local network address to the local network interface.      The local network interface creates a local network header, and attaches the datagram to it, then sends the result via the local network.      The datagram arrives at a gateway host wrapped in the local network header, the local network interface strips off this header, and turns the datagram over to the internet module.  The internet module determines from the internet address that the datagram is to be forwarded to another host in a second network.  The internet module determines a local net address for the destination host.  It calls on the local network interface for that network to send the datagram.      This local network interface creates a local network header and attaches the datagram sending the result to the destination host.      At this destination host the datagram is stripped of the local net header by the local network interface and handed to the internet module.      The internet module determines that the datagram is for an application program in this host.  It passes the data to the application program in response to a system call, passing the source address and other parameters as results of the call.

Internet protocol interfaces on one side to the higher level host-to-host protocols and on the other side to the local network protocol.  In this context a "local network" may be a small network in a building or a large network such as the ARPANET.     The  model of operation for transmitting a datagram from one application program to another is illustrated by the following scenario:      We suppose that this transmission will involve one intermediate gateway.      The sending application program prepares its data a
