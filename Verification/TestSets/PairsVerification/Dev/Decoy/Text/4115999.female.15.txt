I am so terrified about not being able cope with whats to come in the next chapters of my life, but I am gratefull for all my friends because I know that they will always be there me, and thats really comforting.  Dude my friends are so awesome, they're so random and funny. But I'm goin go, cause all this mushy stuff is gettin to me.
Grrr....I'm really tired but I can't get tired   tired, like the sleepy tired. Eh, anyway. WOO! I am   most likely goin do something tomorrow with   someone, my good friends know who that is...Well   atleast I think they do. Hm...I want a m  uffin. I guess I'm done. Nothin else to say/type.     ......  arn't   the   colors   perdy?
OMG...I hate this computer I had a lot of stuff typed and ready to publish and guess what?! It freezes! I lost all of it. Well anyway, this guy called at 5:30 in the freakin morning asking for someone named Jenny....Well it took awhile for me to convince him that no one named Jenny lives here. I swear it was so aggravating. Well, dad doesn't get home till like 11 tonight, kinda cool. I really want to go to the mall this weekend, I feel like shopping. I want to go to Sweden. Don't know why just do. Geez...I am so bored, I need to do something....Maybe I'll go for a run or something. Eh maybe not it's kinda hot outside. Plus I'm way to lazy for that type of thing. Well, I have nothing else to bore you with at the moment.
la la la la la la la.....i felt like la-ing.
*blank stare* It's kinda late but I have no intension of going to bed anytime soon, even though my eyes are excruciatingly tired, but oh well. Is ponderment a word? I guess so. I feel like sky-diving anyone wanna join me? When will I ever meet a guy that I truly c  onnect with. I like someone now, but I pretty sure they don't like me like I like them, but oh well I suppose. I have a deep feeling for a serious relationship like a few of my friends, but I'm not predicting that anytime soon in the forecast of my boring "love life" or "like life" whatever you want to call it. Eh, I got to sneeze....Just thought I'd let you all know that. Welp, my fingers are tired so ITS OVER!!!
!Bow shicka bow bow! I think I'm going to do something tomorrow but I have no clue what. Gar. People make me really mad sometimes, they're so stupid. I wonder if my mom would let me dye my hair red....Or at least highlight it. Welp I have nothing else to say so ITS OVER!!!!
