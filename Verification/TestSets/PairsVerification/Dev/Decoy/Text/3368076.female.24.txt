as punch! I really hated that job anyway. But I put up w/ it b/c the $$$$ rocked, I got to wear pj's all day long and the perks made me feel like a celeb. But, it couldn't make up for the fact that I absolutely dreaded the work.   UP  After two short weeks and heaps of melodrama, I landed a job in the accounting dept of a manufacturing company. Fate is funny - the company headquarters is in Quebec. I was never very good at speaking French, even though I grew up speaking a bit of it. (Ask me sometime, also the reason why I wanted to be a nun) I like the job and I adore my co-workers. It's kind of fun dusting off my language skills, On any given day, I get to speak to people in Spanish and Portuguese. I fake my way through French and I have to "translate" all kinds of languages from Polish to Swedish. Haven't had a change to use my (feeble) Japanese yet though. Yes, you heard me right - it's an accounting position.   DOWN DOWN UP  Speaking of French - The weekend of the 4th came. Fireworks. yup. those things. For the most part, I have a lousy memory. I'm not good at remembering dates, but I always remember good ole independence Day. (also Cinco De Mayo) Last year, the 4th became an even sadder day of remembrance.

Check out his website for the recording we made of J'rai La Voir Un Jour. It was so cathartic.    DOWN  Car started dying last week. Poor little thing. First, it started running and shifting real rough like. Checked the fluids. Needed oil and coolant. Thought maybe I got some bad petrol. But then, over the next few days, it got worse. Yada yada yada, I think I need a new transmission and I don't want to put that kind of money into the Celeb. Decided that I just had to suck it up and buy a car.....   UP!  On Saturday, Daddy helped me look for a new ride. As usual, I made the decision pretty impulsively. The deal is clinched, but not finalised yet. Wanna know what I'm buying? Stay tuned...!   UP AND DOWN  Seriously - my head is spinning. It IS possible to have too much of a good thing, and I don't know how I'm going to handle it any longer. If life is like a box of chocolates, then I say: love is like a bag of Lays....I can't have 'just one.' (BTW, what pervo came up w/ that slogan? Brill!)   Solution:  Need more shopping time to clear my h
