...The novelty wore off after a couple of weeks.  I've seen her wandering around the neighborhood in her nightgown and yelling at people who drive by. Once i got stopped by her when I came home from work. She grabbed ahold of my hand and wouldn't let go. I had to pry her off finger by finger.  The other day I brought a balloon home from work and threw it out with the trash when it got flat. The next morning, I saw it hanging from her railing. Who digs through the dumpster and opens trash bags for a balloon? I know it was my balloon, too, because it was a specially made blue and yellow one.  About a week ago, we went to the neighborhood bar for a drink. Kay was there, carrying around a squeaky dog toy. I think she thought she was pretty hot shit, too, because she was hanging all over a couple of guys there and squeaking the toy in their faces. Eventually, the bartender cut her off and she ended up hooking up with some young drunk kid. She never came home that night.
...here I am, creating a blog. Where should I begin?   I moved into my current apartment complex eight months ago. I always joked with my boyfriend Francesco that it was a  "retirement community" because most people here are twice our age. We never met any of our neighbors because everyone kept to themsleves. Until mid May, that is. It was about that time that Kathy stopped taking her medication and started drinking vodka. Heavily.  Kathy is the tenant who lives directly across the street from us. Approximately three times a week, always between three and four in the morning, the police, firetrucks, and paramedics have been called to her unit. We always have a  perfect view of everything. At first, it was quite interesting, but....
I hear strange noises coming from outside. I step out on my balcony and discover Kay rooting around in the weeds in the canyon behind my apartment:  urlLink     Later, Kay is yelling at the neighbor above her. Something about having some friends over. "Charlie's Angels!" she yells. "Three white cats!" "It's Christmas eve!" She spends the evening tinkering around with stuff on her patio. The next morning.....
Not much has changed. Kay still digs through the dumpster, puts stuff in the trash then takes it back, and harrasses passing vehicles. Here's a good example:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     These three young men were visiting a friend I believe. Kay stops them as they are leaving and tries to get them to come over to her house. "Hey, red shirts!" she calls. "I have carne asada! And corn on the cob! I'm going to have a feast!" The boys stand around awkwardly, not knowing how to politely decline the crazy lady. They eventually just get in their car and leave, while she calls after them "Come back in half an hour! I'll have a feast ready for you!"
