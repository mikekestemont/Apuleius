My visit to  urlLink Julia's  in Jamestown got off to a fabulous start...   urlLink    Inside the Southern Tier Brewing Company.
I thought I would post this uber-cool picture of the sun in honor of the first day of Summer.   urlLink Read this for an explanation of why it's all those pretty colors .   urlLink    The Sun&nbsp; urlLink
Perhaps we should change the name to 'A Beer Blog Between Friends'.   urlLink    Ben and Ryan toasting the Beer Gods
I never used to have friends over to my parent's house while growing up.  Now that I'm older there seems to be no problem with having a few friends over for many, many beers.  Here's Ryan in his traditional pose - lounging with a beer in hand.   urlLink    Ryan Drinking A Beer&nbsp; urlLink
I don't remember if this kitty crawled in the box or if someone put her there.  Cheers to cats and beer!   urlLink    Kitty In A Beer Box&nbsp; urlLink
This is one of my favorite pictures I've taken of the Stutson Street Bridge.  Even though it's old, seemingly rickety, and noisy, I'll still miss it when they knock it down.   urlLink    Stutson Street Bridge at Sunset&nbsp; urlLink
So,  urlLink Julia  and  urlLink I  seem to be on the same wavelength all the damn time.  About a half an hour ago, we were chatting about all the photos we have, but that we never have enough time to send them to each other, not to mention all of our other friends who should see them.

urlLink    Anne and our mid-afternoon margaritas while on a break from shopping on Tuesday.  It was much needed after marauding with the awful Maureens.
urlLink    4th of July post-fireworks at Bru.  2 stouts and a pale ale, but which is which?  Oh, the insanity!   Correction:  It was a Scotch Ale that Ben had.  Meh.  Happy, now?
urlLink    The only way to hula-hoop.  (Susan)  Sunday evening, we went over to Ben and Susan's for dinner.  After several beers, Susan decided we should all take a turn on the piano and each do 2 songs.  Instead, Susan and I ended up, by ourselves, playing drunken Ben Folds (what else?) tunes.  My punishment?  An episode of  urlLink Black Adder .  I won't do it again, I promise!  Can't wait for Friday's  urlLink The Big Lebowski  viewing, complimented by the consumption o
