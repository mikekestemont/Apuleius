Three issues cropped up today. I'm not always convinced that consumer boycotts make much difference - but I do buy Fairtrade when I can so I'm feeling I should follow this through consistently. So:   My partner and I don't eat meat but do eat fish. However, today she saw a whole rainbow trout for sale - head and everything still attached - and that's put her off eating fish completely.

Welcome to Authentic Lives, a Blog about my growing interest in living authentically. I'll write from time to time about my successes, lapses, dilemas and life in general. I'd love to hear from you so do comment and/or send e-mail when you have something to say.   If you've stumbled across this and am wondering what authenticity is all about I recommend you take a look at the  urlLink Authentic Business  website.

As ever, all notions of authenticity and living an ethical life are more complex than they at first appear; but it's better to try and make some progress in the right direction than to not bother - better for us as individuals, and better for society as a whole. And from the ecology aspect, it might just help stop us from destroying the planet.  My current dilemma is that I seem to have developed an intolerance of roll on deodorants, so I'm looking for a spray that doesn't pump out too many harmful chemicals and hasn't been tasted on animals. I've drawn a blank so far - any s
