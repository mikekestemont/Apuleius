"But for the use of physical punishment by, and fear of, their oppressors, animals would never be a part of a circus." â€” Richard Pryor  Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus paints a picture of happy animals doing tricks because they like to. We ask you to read the following and decide whether that's true. Here are Ringling's own words juxtaposed with the facts:Ringling:"At Ringling Bros., the relationship between animals and humans is built on mutual respect, trust, and affection." Reality:Video footage of Ringling trainers shows an elephant being whipped in the face and gouged with metal hooks. Ringling:"We are proud of our USDA inspection reports." Reality:Ringling Bros.' USDA inspection reports are riddled with instances in which federal inspectors found that Ringling Bros. had failed to comply with minimum federal regulations, and the circus has been cited for causing animals unnecessary trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, and discomfort, a failure to provide animals with veterinary care, a failure to provide animals exercise, a failure to provide sufficient space, as well as not keeping the proper veterinary records.

Instead, the circus forces them to perform night after night, for 48 to 50 weeks every year. Between acts, elephants are kept chained and tigers are "stored" in cages with barely enough room to take one step. Ringling has also invented a "unicorn" by mutilating a baby goat--surgically moving his horns to the center of his forehead. Ringling:"Future generations will be able to experience the wonder ... of Asian elephants because of what we're doing today." Reality:Circuses have claimed for decades that exhibiting endangered Asian elephants will inspire their protection. Yet in 2000, poachers killed 60 free-roaming female elephants so that their babies could be collected and sold to the entertainment industry. The still-nursing elephants, all under the age of 3, refused to abandon their dead mothers, even attempting to suckle from their corpses.
