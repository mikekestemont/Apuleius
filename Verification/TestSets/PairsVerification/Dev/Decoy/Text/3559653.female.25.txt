we're going to get an early start to avoid major problems. Kris mentioned a back-up plan--a study online having to do with sexual aggression and psychopathy--so I'm sure it will all work out. I would really like to stick with the offender data though since I find it really fascinating. I've been doing lit searches like mad and already have some deadlines to meet--first review of project proposal to Kris by Sept. 9th, then to Steve by mid-September, and complete intro. section for my thesis to Steve by end of September. YIKES!!! I'm wondering where I'm going to find the time but I think I can pull it off. I guess I'll just be up to my eyeballs in journal articles for the next few weeks! Looks like me and the laptop are going to be spending lots of QT together. :P  Needless to say, I've kind of switched my crazy standardized-test plans up a bit in light of how busy I'm going to be in the next 2 months. I'm 95% sure that I'll be doing the GRE (general and psychology) in November and the LSAT in December, it just makes more sense to me. I only want to have to write each test once so I'd better get cracking on some quality studying!  My hateful stats class is not over yet, but after tomorrow, only 4 more classes and one is the final! woooohooo! I don't think I've ever hated a class more than this one. I pulled off another 100% on my last assignment so hopefully those marks will keep me afloat if my midterm mark is that bad. I'm actually starting to get excited for my Fall classes, and now that I have this stats class under my belt, I'm not so worried about the psych stats class. I'm kind of looking forward to knowing what I'm doing when it comes time to analyze my data!  I'm starting to panic a bit about this being my last year. I hope I figure out what the heck I want to do soon! Probably won't know until December though folks, depends on those test scores. If at all possible, I am going to do nothing but travel and scrapbook next summer!!! I'm definitely starting to get excited about the possibility of going to Europe with Malcolm, and I'd love to get a Newfoundland trip in too--I'm obsessed with the idea of hiking the east coast trail! It looks awesome, check it out here:   urlLink http://www.eastcoasttrail.com/   10 days and counting until Robyn's wedding, I can hardly believe it's almost here! It's going to be cool to see everything come together after hearing about all of the plans for the last few months. I have my next dress fitting on Friday, and all I can say is that it better go better than the last one did!!  That's all for now...I'm wiped, must get to bed. Oh, the sookie word of the day is   SOMBIE  ...which translates to "sookie zombie" which is what I feel like right now. Miss you S
