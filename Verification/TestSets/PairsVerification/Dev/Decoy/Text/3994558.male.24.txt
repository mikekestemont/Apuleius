profile already available will do. However, the profile MUST contain at least one picture.     Most sites allow filtering of profiles "with photos only". This is important because "a picture is worth a thousand words". Even if the number of women online is much less than the number of men, that still represents too many profiles to read. As such, "serious" daters should have a picture in their profile and should expect the same from others. Better yet, some sites allow  for multiple pictures and this greatly enhance the selection process.    Only men's profiles are available for browsing / searching, women's profile are only made available upon contact. As a consequence, women must contact the men, men have no way to contact women until first contacted by them. The service is entirely free for women. For men, either a flat-rate monthly or a fee to open messages. Incidentally, the messages could be hidden and the woman's profile reviewed before accepting the fee.    Only being able to browse men's profiles solve 3 problems. First, it greatly diminishes the solicitation of women's attention. Women only contact men they are interested in and are not "bombarded" with requests. Second, because the service is free for women, they can really focus on the candidates that interest them. Finally, the dating procedure becomes clear. Women contact men, contact is free for them and paying for men. Men review messages and  communicate with interesting women.    The site should be divided in sections with regard to intent. For example, Lavalife has 3 sections: "intimate encounter", "dating" and "relationship". HOWEVER, there is a lot of confusion between "dating" and "relationship". Following common sense, dating first, and a relationship follows if dating is right and, consequently, "dating" and "relationship" should become one section. But there could be a "just looking for friends" section created to compensate.    The sections are a good thing because it separates people with totally different intent in parallel, non-touching, universes. No wasting time looking at profiles of people who want a one-night-stand when you are interested in a more serious type of relationship.       CONCLUSIONS AND ISSUES:     This new way to present online dating switches the focus from women to men. It is my belief that this would be a better system because, by its nature, it does reduce or even eliminate the 4 problems discussed above.         the service becomes free for women.     women are not solicitated by the masses.     the experience empowers women and might give them a better opinion of online dating. And because women have to do the work, only serious candidates will bother.     the procedure is simple.      Of course the problems discussed above does not apply to same-sex dating. I am not familiar with these issues in that context and suggests others to voice their opinion on the subject.
I guess this is the beginning.    I've been feeling like ranting a lot lately.  Lots of things that piss me off which need to come out.  I guess my goal is just to rant a lot.  I might diversify and actually provide useful information / c
