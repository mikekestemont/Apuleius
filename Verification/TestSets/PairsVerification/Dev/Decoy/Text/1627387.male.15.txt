Cheating...  Why do people do it? I mean if they aren't happy with their boyfriend/girlfriend, they should break up with that person. If they aren't happy with their spouse that means they either rushed into marriage or just didn't do a good job picking a person that they would spend their LIFE with.  If you're scared of commitment/future/past/anything involving the person you're marrying, DON'T GET MARRIED! I mean damn, it's just common sense people.  Now there are the people who cheat on a boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse cuz it gives them a "rush." Bad idea guys. I mean come on, we're not 14 here, well some of us are, but that's not the point. it you want a rush, try something that won't hurt anyone besides yourself. Skydiving or bull riding are excellent examples of adrenaline junkies.  [And paintball! -Ed.]   Then you have the people who "just can't seem to help it." these people should never enter into serious relationships with boys/girls/dogs until they mature a lil bit. I'm sorry, but "I couldn't hep it" is not a valid excuse, you can always help it.  I'm just losing hope in people in general. I am starting to doubt I will ever find a nice girl who WON'T cheat on me. I've been surrounded by cheaters my whole life, and it's not a good feeling to have growing up/living with.  In short, I hope I am lucky enough to find a girl who will stay as faithful to me as I will be to her.  thank you for baring with me through all of my /'s and general ranting.
my computer is still dead and Mike is Sexe. I'm off to call Ariel:)
well, still no news on the car situation. I guess no news it good news though. at least you don't have to pay for no news. it's free, like public television.    &nbsp;  in other news, I want to be this guy when I grow up!       &nbsp;
My car broke down today! Everything is all backwards! I'm not having very good luck with anything besides girls! It's not supposed to work that way! My car was working just fine last night, and then all of the sudden today BAM! Overheat in the face!       On a lighter note, I'm eating a blueberry muffin and it is good.       More updates as they develop.
well, the situation is worse than I had originally thought. not only is my hard drive not working correctly, it's dead! no, hard drives can't die... IT WAS MURDERED! so yeah, my computer is dead til at least saturday. I get paid friday, and won't have time to go get a new hard drive til, at the earliest, saturday.  oh well, I'm sure I'll live, I'll just have to talk to people the old fashioned way, by telephone...
Fork's got the woo-WOO!
well, I'm gonna have to reformat my hard drive today... great fun. I also have to work, so I probably won't get to do it til tonight. oh well, shyte happens.    on a lighter note, I got to spend 5 straight hours with Ariel yesterday. t
