not too shabby.   i had already eaten dinner, plus earlier a couple of chips with guac, several deviled eggs and some olives. took meds at 5:45
well, i didnt really eat a breakfast - several slices of pepperoni and a large english cuke. However at TJ's I had a small cup of coffee and cream and I just wolfed down a cup of cottage cheese. I dont know how soon the sugar soars after ingestion. time for a med.   i either mised my glipizid this morning or taking an extra one for lunch.
okay okay okay. we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that. I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm.
so taking meds now to abate dinner, but I think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?  Last night however, i took them rather late, because I ate rather late.  I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we'll see what happens in the am. but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me.    ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.   bleh.  ANYWAY, still way less carbs than normal
not too shabby, i am feeling a little lightheaded and trying to gauge when my sugars are low or high.   i took one glucophage at 1pm but did not eat. about 90 min ago I had a about 10 raisens (naughty, probably 15 carbs just there) and a bowlful of broccoli and cheese. This eaten at least two hours after taking my meds.
yeah buddie!  Had 4 eggs and chorizo for breakfast, snack was en entire english cuke. sippin on splenda kool-aid right now. no ttoo hungry for lunch.   I have not been taking the metabo boosters, I think they were nauseating me
so... whats the secret?  last night i took my meds at ten and I had, only 4 eggs con chorizo - 4 carbs. nothing for 10 hours. why is my blood sugar so fucking high?  dammit  also, I feel heavy today. total carbs yesterday less than 60, so what gives.
had an entire english cuke about 4:00 and half a nasty atkins shake just a bit ago. I havent had meds since 1pm and my blood is 1
