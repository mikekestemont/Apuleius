pretty bright.  Then, I spent today doing nothing.  I have got finals all next week, but it is only three days, and two of them are basically half days, which is aweesome.  So, I have three days of hell left, then I am out of there and a senior.  Camp starts in two weeks, and that is awesome.  I can't wait.  Well, this will be my last post until next year.  See you all at camp in two weeks.  I'm out of here.
I had an awesome weekend.  The first part wasn't so good, when I was at my band concert.  We did horrible, or that is what I think.  Oh well.  Then, as most of you know, I went to the staff weekend.  IT was cool.  I did a little work, saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in a while, and had fun.  It is always good to be able to go back to Ransburg.  I can't wait till summer starts.  I want to go back to camp so much.  I have one and a half weeks left of school.  It will be awesome when school is finally over.  Then I will be a senior and have only one year left.  Stephen's Eagle Court of Honor is tomorrow, and Will and I are doing basically the whole ceremony.  It should be pretty sweet.  So now all of the Crayner's have reached the rank of Eagle, that is pretty cool.  Now all that Stephen has to do is get all of the merit badges, and he is really close.  He has 90 and only needs 30 more.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya!
Hey.  I had a great weekend.  I went down to see Laura.  It was fun.  Then Sunday I just sat around all day.  That was pretty cool.  Yesterday I went to the Fermi Lab in Chicago for a physics field trip.  It was pretty cool.  For lunch we went to this restaurant where they take pride in being mean.  It was crazy, though they did have good food there.  On the Fermi Lab grounds there were buffalo, we did not really know why they were there, but they were cool.  I got home from that at 9:30.  Then I spent the rest of the night bullshitting a project, that I did better on that I thought I would.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya
Hey.  The spring fellowship went well.  I got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while.  That is always good.  I got to do things with fircrafter which is also always good.  It is awesome, Friday and Monday I get to go on field trips.  That is sweet, two days where I get to do nothing all day, the only thing is make-up work, but it looks like there won't be that much.  Life is good.  Well, not much is going on in my life right now, so not a very big post, but no one likes reading a long post anyways.  Got to go.  See y
