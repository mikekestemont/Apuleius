within your heart  I won't be far away, for life goes on.  So if you need me, call and I will come.  Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near; And if you listen within your heart you'll hear  All my love around you soft and clear. And then when you come this way alone  I'll greet you with a smile and say, "Welcome Home." --Author Unknown  I know that we'll see each other again, my dear Drew. So until that time, QaPla!  Hug your loved ones today!  Peace!
"What you up to? Not much; how 'bout you?"  This is how my conversation with Chris started this morning. The funeral for Drew is Saturday. Still can't believe he's gone. My head is still spinning, and Chris is so lost and hurting right now. I wish I could just take Chris' pain, but I know that I can't.  Colm is such a wonderful man! When he and I decided to move our relationship forward, I don't think he knew what he was getting himself into. Life seemed simpler two months ago. No tragedies, no family drama. But since we said yes, my Dad went into hospital with a major heart attack, another good friend of mine was diagnosed with colon cancer, Drew dies; and yet, Colm has been by my side through all of this, being my strength, the shoulder to cry on, the arms to hold and comfort me. After the funeral, I think Colm and I need to get away for a few days.  Jumbled thoughts today from a frazzled mind.  Peace!
1 August 2004 - a new month has begun again!  It's hard to believe that we are now in the eighth month of 2004. Time seemingly begins to accelerate as we get older; this realization is a little frightening.  Colm and I did a little road trip yesterday after spending most of the day with Chris. We drove up to Santa Barbara. I have loved that place since I was seven. Every summer my family would spend a week up there. I just love the city. On the coast, about 85 miles north of Los Angeles. Temperatures are great throughout the year. Anyway, I digress...  We walked along the water, out onto the pier and just enjoyed each other's company. We then walked up State St and ate in one of the many bistros. I love this man with all my heart and am so grateful that he is in my life. He is funny, kind, gentle, compassionate, and so beautiful, on the inside, as well as the outside. I think about how devastated Chris is with the death of Drew. Ever feel guilty for having something that someone else whom you love has lost? That's describes a part of me right now. I confuse easily when shite happens.  On the ride back, I just enjoyed hearing Colm sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat. My heart swelled with love, pride, and admiration. Moments like these knock things into perspective. Hold your loved ones tightly and enjoy them!  P
