new suitemate is cool. I also hope/wonder if anyone read that last post I did. Even if no one did, or if the people who did thought it was terrible, I'm going to start proofreading and spell checking those things. That was just embarassing.  urlLink This  guy sure as hell wouldn't agree with what I said, but at least I didn't ignore the foreign based and backed insurgents. It's not like they're exactly part of the Iraqis for Iraq but against the US group. They fall into a much different category. But never say I don't provide alternate viewpoints here.    Boring, yet Important   - Possible bad  urlLink news  for Bush and for America as a whole - Job growth slowed dramatically in June, as employers added just 112,000 workers to payrolls last month, a number that came in well below forecasts by private economists. Bush still praised the report and used it as proof for the 1.5 million jobs gained since August. The Treasury Secretary noted that the Labor Department's house survey, which uses different methods (an exact method is a notoriously controversial to economists) showed a growth of 295,000 jobs in June.   - Preparing/worrying for the future. The US Navy is planning a massive show of force in the Pacific Ocean near China to register a point with Beijing. An unprecedented seven aircraft carrier strike groups will be organized for an excersize well within striking distance of China. Presumably, this is to remind China the US's somewhat undeclared policy in dealing with Taiwan. China currently only has the ability to confront one CGO, let alone seven. If worse came to worse, (depending on the effectiveness of the AEGIS anti missle system) Taiwan may be bombarded all to hell, but no Chinese troops should make it to the island and effectivly occupy it.  -The Federal Reserve has  urlLink raised  interest rates for the first time in over four years. A steady stream of further rises in the cost of borrowing is now likely—unless America’s high-spending, heavily-indebted households suddenly retreat  - Dance you magnificent bastard,  urlLink dance .    That's all for now.
No Christyn, I deserve nothing of the sort.  /3rd person  Tyson will be arriving at KCI at roughly 5:00 PM on Saturday, August 7th, 2004.  He is taking a side trip to Maine on the 6th. He will be very tired and will have traveled all day.  He is actually beginning to feel a mixture of sadness and blind rage at leaving, among other things best not discussed.  If there is no banner nor some sort of altar with votive candles set up waiting for him, he will be severly disappointed in you all.  He has missed you all a great deal, and is excited to see you all again, and to leave some of the bullshit here far far far behind.  He is also now the proud owner of his very own Hookah.  That is all.
Deeyamn   Once again, so that's what  that's  like.  So much experience in so little time.  I hate to see your faces when you read t
