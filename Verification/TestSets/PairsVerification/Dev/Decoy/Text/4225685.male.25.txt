the fridge that remotely resembled a mixer was......fuckin' orange juice. Now I mean, OJ and Crown Royal don't really go hand in hand and the fact there was more Crown Royal than OJ in these fucking drinks made it incredibly disgusting. The words that were ringing through my head were..... awesome.....this is just awesome. We left my house and hit the liquor store. Our name for the hockey team is the Olde Englishmen. This refers to the 40oz bottles of eight percent malt liquor called Olde English. Since we are the Olde Englishmen it would be fitting to drink Olde English. So we go to the liquor store and pick up a more than satisfactory supply. I also happened to bring with me a beautiful Stella Artois glass. Perfect for pouring eight percent malt liquor into and then chugging within seconds. I'm a fuckin' genius. We get to Shaune's house, everybodys mingling and the OEs are cracking. Good ol' Stella had become the house whore and was pretty much on everybody's lips. Before I could even muster the strength to blurt "I'm fuckin' hammered" there was no more fuckin' OE and everybody was.....well..... hammered. It was a goddamn gong show. Apparently my friend Skye decided to start drinking some more Crown Royal.....straight. They had purchased a two six of CR that I forgot about. This would deliver a fatal blow to Skye's entire body, punishing him for the next day. Now just to cut this story a little short I'm going to skip to the end of this incredible night. We're all out on the street trying to figure out how the fuck we're all gonna get home. We have a couple of other teammates trying to convince us to ride with them but we don't want to cause they're hammered as well. So finally being the rocket scientist that I am, I get fed up with all of the waiting and tell Skye (who was bent over dry heaving at that very moment) to give me his keys. He does. I take his keys start up his car and ask if anyones coming. Burfag trys to remove the keys from the ignition but I remove his hands from the car. I ask one more time if anyones coming. Burfag then says "I'm not driving with you, you're fuckin' drunk." With that I just take off and leave all of them to walk (which they already decided that they wanted to do). The funny thing is, while I was almost home I went through a yellow light. I didn't fly through it, I just coasted through, but guess who came around the corner just after. Mr Policeman. I came up to a 4 way stop to turn left and he whipped up on my right and took a good look at me. I proceeded with my left turn and he kept going straight. Close call. He should of arrested me and thrown my ass in the drunk tank. I know I'm a fuckin' idiot. I promise I won't do it a
