 Mummy who are all these people? Hehe.. Nice title dude.. Wish you all the best in setting up a company and don't forget me when you get married.. Oh if by any chance you see Amer, kick his ass for me.. Hahaha.. lol.. Hope to go over and see you sometimes..  Gotta go all.. Life's a bitch.. What else is new? More work and more headaches..
urlLink    This is Don.. Well we met because of Jason.. I've known him as far back since I known Lincoln and he's one special guy.. He doesn't talk much about his prob though even though we tried hard to open him up but I guess he has his reasons.. He was working with IKEA and now he's with DIGI.. He decided to come to Johor with us and we ended up playing monopoly and PS the whole weekend.. Miss those times dude? I know I do man..&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This is my buddy Lincoln.. We're like heaven and earth since he's super big and I'm super skinny.. Lol.. But we've gone through a lot and he's still my buddy no matter what happens.. Thanks for being there for me and what's that on your hand?? Ciggy?? Oh god... damn.. Well too late anyway.. Just don't burn my bed alright? Haha.. This pic was taken on the 27th April 2002 which is two years back.. We had tons of fun and we drank beer!! Haha.. I miss the good old days..&nbsp; urlLink
Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing I am captivated, I am...  [Chorus] Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that I am...  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current So let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Like hope Dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...
