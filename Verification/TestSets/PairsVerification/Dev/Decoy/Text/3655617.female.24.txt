Okay so Atlanta Bread… cute guys and the old lady version of Christian – Ha! I completely had forgotten about that and my sister started playing with her boy toy’s digital camera. This older lady was in A.B. and taking digital photos from a little table while her husband carried the food over I thought… hummm… I wonder if Christian does that...  Photographers do it in dark rooms!
When I cross people on the street, sit next to them on the bus – my mind wanders into little stories about how they got there and where they are going. Some people don’t let you imagine. Some people smell like 76 open bottles of beer on the wall and slur up to you telling you a nice little spanish girl shouldn’t be hanging out with a white girl. I’m so thankful that only happened once. So a few people win the lottery, others learn to love, little boys get puppies for Christmas. (Most of my stories are *really* sugar coated!)   *blech* I’m not wasting my time on filth and anger…  Little stories, poetic lyrics, love triangles (though I don’t like to be *in* them,) haunted houses and full lives – I love ‘em. Confidence, don’t mistake that one for ego. Appetizers, intelligent conversation, and my newest penchant strawberry wine! It’s not babble… my mind just likes to wander. And all I wanted to say was maybe I like lyrics because I like those poetic stories – brevity set to music. Something I can’t do, and I don’t want to.

And after it was all over she walked into her messy kitchen and... made macaroni and cheese...  That was a dreadfull storm and as I sat on my laundry room floor hopeing all my cats were away from the windows all I could think of was, 'damn is it ever going to END!' I adore rainy weather. I love to dance in it. I love to sleep, there may not be a better lullaby. But ~ this was bad. Knowing me I wouldn't have taken it as seriously if my family wasn't there freaking out about my reading on the couch WAY TO CLOSE TO THE WINDOW!!!  I'd take a snowstorm anyday.  No electricity for two days. No AC... plenty of SWELLTERING HEAT though... I couldn't sleep. I did almost finish with my book. (I read them I don't write them.)  My sisters and I were going to have a Boggle game or two... it was too hot to think! My brain is still a bit singed... I do rather want to finish the pages I have left... then I'm going to rent Needful Things and see how different it is from what I read.  I am really excited about going to see Garden State. I've discussed this a little with Elise and I'm going to have to start stalking Zach Braff. Z & N - think about i
