).     &nbsp;  Also, I cleaned my room. And by clean, I mean straightened up. Things shifted from one shelf to a drawer, and from desk to box. Orderly looking on the outside, but really only hidden piles of junk. Not to say that all my junk is stowed away, but at least now it's... slightly better.    &nbsp;  Tomorrow looks to be as interesting as today.    &nbsp;  I would highly recommend the book  The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit  by Storm Constantine, but I'm only a short way into it. So far it proves to be excellent reading, though.    &nbsp;  I wish I had more to say for a first post.. Oh well, I suppose.    &nbsp;  Thank you and goodnight.
This just came to me: You know how your parents always make a big deal about the first word you ever said? Could a person's first word have any effect on the type of person they turn out to be? I wonder...  &nbsp; I know for a fact that my first word was "shit." No joke.  What was your first word? Let's compare!
Billy Joel's "Zanzibar" is the perfect song to get one motivated on a cool July day. That and looking forward to New York ;^p    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   The inning isn't over yet for me...       &nbsp;  Talk to you all later! *hugs*
Why do I constantly feel let down?   Are my expectations too high?   Or have you never been as perfect as my mind portrayed you?    &nbsp;  The streets are uneven and my eyes won't raise.    &nbsp;  Why are the meanings to actions never interpreted correctly?    &nbsp;  Why don't questions have answers?    &nbsp;  One of those days... (weeks? months?) where nothing is sufficient and everything only seems to get worse.   Every day spent leaning towards the next.   Is one solid hope worth more than a carload of certainties?   Tonight I'd beg to differ.    &nbsp;  Nothing is sustainable    I'm only delaying inevitability.    &nbsp;  Why is it we only miss the past?   [why can't heartfelt kisses make another person open their eyes]   I wish I could move my eyes elsewhere
Well kids, let you be the first to hear,      Jordan and I are no longer a couple. Again.         Being worthless isn't so bad, right?
I was pleasently surprised to find out that the service that I had to sing at today was only 30 minutes, but I still got paid 100. This has added to my happiness level. YES!      Anyway, it's been a while since I last typed something here. Just letting you all know I'm alive.  I know you're all disappointed, sorry ;^p.      Psyched for Florida!         Anyways, I've got to go. I'll talk to you all later.
Aren't we just the talkative group.         Schedule has been flip flopped.. changed around.. I finally have to start worrying about college.      It's funny how things catch you off gaurd. The things you've expected the most. I wish this were as easy for me.      And of course.. Senior Pictures...       I wish this were easier.    But then again, I wish for a lot of things.      If only I weren't just being shrugged o
