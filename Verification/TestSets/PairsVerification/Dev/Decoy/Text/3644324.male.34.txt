I saw Micheal Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 on the weekend. Before I go any further I will make confess the following biases:   I am Canadian I perceive the American Presidency to be an awesome responsibility that must exceed even the most brilliant and moral person's capabilities. If the U.S. were to offer me the opportunity to vote I would spend a great deal of time assuring myself I understood which chad lined up with which candidate and then I would punch out the one beside whoever was most likely to garner more votes than George W. Bush. I have a difficult time believing in huge conspiracty theories as I am inclined to agree with a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln that says "You can fool some of the people some of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time." I believe that while politicians, in North America at least, are generally well intentioned people, they are susceptible to being misguided.  So, that said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter, though I would caution you that it contains many graphic and disturbing images that no child should be exposed to under any circumstances - images that are still bouncing around, causing trouble, inside my skull.  Mr Moore's film suggests the following, actually it suggests many more things but I'll limit my discussion to:  George W. Bush and his administration were responsible for Sept 11 due to their laziness and incompetence in the summer before the attacks occured. George W. Bush is not intelligent. The Saudi royal family is evil. The BinLaden family is evil and supporting Osama The Bush family is in the pocket of the Saudi royal family. George W. Bush is waging the war in Iraq to benefit defence contractors that his family, friends and the House of Saud have investments in and oil companies. The Iraqi people are not better off after their "liberation". The troops in Iraq are in a horrible situation because they believe they are there to help but the Iraqis don't see it that way   I don't think that the film manages to overwhealmingly prove most of its assertions but it definitely provides disturbing information and makes you question the administration's methods and intentions. This is a political film but putting that aside it still captures the viewer and holds your attention throughout. Well done.
Swarmy Swarmers!    After I finished toweling off I reached down and dug my wallet out of my bag. I found the twenties and handed them to the waiting hand across the bed. I thought with pleasure about all we'd done today and the other four times I'd been here.    "Well, Kevin, thanks a lot. I feel so much better now.", I said as I got up to leave.    "No problem Glenn. I guess I'll see you...." Kevin paused expectantly.   "I'm sure it won't be very long before I'll need you again." I said with a chuckle.    "Remember w
