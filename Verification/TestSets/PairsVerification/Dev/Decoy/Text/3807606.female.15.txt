get with him that I just can't explain, but it's there. A good feeling..a feeling I love. I just feel lucky. A year ago I was complaining about how ALL my friends had boyfriends and I was NEVER going to find a good guy. And now, a year later...wow, can you believe how much you grow up over a year... not literally *grow* in my case (like height wise), but like personally. hehe Brad's just great too. He's everything i've always wanted and more. He's nice, cute, funny, smart, fun, etc., etc. He makes me want to be a better person and change the negative things in life to something better. He always makes me smile (except sometimes makes me cry lol) and he cares about me/worries if I am hurt/sick. He's the perfect guy and I don't think I tell him enough how great he is/he doesn't realize how happy/how lucky I feel to have him. Wow, *pours heart out on keyboard* I don't know what will happen in the future but I seriously love him whatever life brings us. Maybe i'm just emotional or deep in love...but it's something. "Love is like the wind, you can't see it, but you can feel it."
Well, i'm going to go live a little...life only comes once...

We got home from the lake late last night around 12:30 AM and I heard about the young lives taken, JP Kindel and Justin Maroney. Two HHS students, juniors. They were only 16 years old...16. I can't believe God took such young lives. He prolly just wanted them up in Heaven for some reason. The sad thing is, they had their whole lives ahead of them. JP was in my spanish class 1st semester. He was pretty good at drawing. I didn't know Justin but my brother did and said he was nice. It really made me think of how precious a life is. How we should live our lives to the fullest with no regrets. What if tomorrow never comes? So live life each day like there is no tomorrow. Spend more time with your family and friends because what if you never see them again? Everyone should be more thankful for what they have rather than always wanting. Well I want to close this post with a prayer that everyone please be safe today on this busy day of celebrating the United States of America's independence. Spend time with loved ones and charish each moment. That's life...

Well this morning I had to get up early to get blood drawn and some tests. Brad called my cell phone and we talked a bit which was cool cause I was super bored. Then Mom took me to Meijers and I got some soundtracks. Now i'm contemplating whether to stay up or to go back to bed. Tonight we're going out to eat with Grandpa and that's pretty much it in my life.
You know how your parents say, "You're only 15." You aren't ONLY 15 but you ARE 15. *sigh* This is a day I wanna be o
