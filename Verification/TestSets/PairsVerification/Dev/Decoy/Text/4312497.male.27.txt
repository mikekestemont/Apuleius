Iraq, except that he wouldn't have gone to war in Iraq, because he's against the war, except when he is for the war, provided he's not actually against the war, or for the war before he's against it before he's for it, or wait a minute...  Honestly, how do people actually take this pathetically pandering excuse for a "leader" seriously?????
NYT has a pfs  urlLink report  on swing states. I love this kinda stuff. What did political junkies used to do with just pencil and paper - no computers, graphics, and available data everywhere?
urlLink CENTCOM  has posted an  urlLink  aerial photo of the Imam Ali Mosque  , with a mortar position on the sidewalk just out front. They don't appear to have spotted any heavy weapons within the shrine itself, though. Anyways, pretty cool photo.
This simply is a  urlLink must-read  column. Perhaps the best I've read yet on the Swift boat kerfuffle.
I have just updated my profile. While anonymity is important to prevent insurrections from the goon, the crow, and "over there", it might be nice to know something about one another. I suggest you do the same.
Every day, I deal with one person in particular who is an asshole.  He's mean, obnoxious, with few redeeming qualities.   This got me wondering, how many other people I've had to associate with in my life who are truly assholes and I'm thinking it's between 8-10.  So the question of the day is what percentage of people are assholes?
It was very moving when Edwards said, "Mr. President, take down these ads."
Pretty decent  urlLink DB  column on Kerry's evolution from a man of many conviction to a man of many caveats:   [O]n Aug. 1, Kerry told George Stephanopoulos: "I think we can significantly change the deployment of troops, not just [in Iraq] but elsewhere in the world. In the Korean peninsula perhaps, in Europe perhaps." When Bush went ahead and outlined a plan along those lines, Kerry blasted the president, saying it was reckless to embrace the idea he had endorsed two weeks before.
What are the guys in the state flag doing?
Though, a cursory inspection of our blog archives did not reveal this, I'm certain that stew and MB will recall my saying that Bush should condemn the Swift Boat Vets ads.   Well, he  urlLink just did it ...obliquely, at least.  Wouldn't it be amazing if Congress changed the campaign finance law to close the 527 loophole, now that Dems have given all this money to these groups?  That would be a truly amazing strategy, though it would bring unprecedented shrieking from the dems to even mention it.
Quinnipiac has JFK up only 8 points on Bush in Connecticut.  If Herman Munster has to defend himself in the liberal northeast, he's toast.
Welcome Peter Gabriel (not the singer, but the caregiver of moms and babymoms across the fruited plain).
The John Locke Foundation is hosting a  urlLink lunch seminar  with an historian - Edward Bonekemper - who will discuss why Ulysses Grant - and not Robert E. Lee - was the greatest general of the Civil War. Any c
