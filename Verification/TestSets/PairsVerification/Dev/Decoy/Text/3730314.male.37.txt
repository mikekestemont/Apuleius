There's one thing that the church is in desperate need of today - fresh thinkers!  I've heard it said that our methods should always change, but our message should not. I wonder. It seems that if you discuss spirituality with people who are not followers of Jesus, a profound insight surfaces. Most non-followers of Jesus do not see anything fresh, relevant, or compelling about our message of "faith".  For the most part, "Christianity" is perceived as a worn out religious world view, with not much worthy of exploration by a generation thirsting for the spiritual.  I believe that's why we need fresh prophets, poets and theologians who are approaching the story of God from a different perspective - and one of the people who I think is on the leading edge of a church culture change is  urlLink Brian McLaren . When I first read  urlLink A New Kind of Christian , I was thinking "YES! This is what I've been thinking and feeling for a long, long time." I was hooked. I just finished reading  urlLink The Story We Find Ourselves In , which was flat out amazing [both are a must read]! Both books have been foundational for so many people who are seeking to architect a new church culture.  It was cool to find out that Brian was here in town teaching, so a group of us headed out and heard him this morning at Capo Beach Calvary. Great time. Challenging thoughts. He spoke on the feeding of the five thousand as a reminder that we are called to turn our attention outside the circle of disciples, and gain a God perspective - on needs, on our involvement, and the fact that Jesus is the bread for a hungry world. Very sweet. If you ever get a chance to read any of Brian's stuff - you'll not regret it!  After the service, we did what every person should... hit  El Molino de Oro  for some authentic breakfast burritos. For those of you who live in South Orange County - you know what I'm talking about!
urlLink    earlier this month, jamie and i had the opportunity to travel to prague, czech republic.  it was an amazing week!  we spent three days exploring the city, and another three teaching at the international baptist theological seminary just outside prague.  together we explored evangelism, followership, and teaching with the emerging culture.  we made great friends, enjoyed some great conversations, and took in the sights of this amazing city.  thanks to all who welcomed us with open arms - even the crazy canadians!&nbsp; urlLink
if there's one thing that's for sure, it's that life is a more of a journey, than a destination.  for far too many of us, we are living our lives for a destination - as if we're waiting and hoping for something to happen in the future.  we see our faith as a ticket to get on the bus to some spiritual destination.  so we see this life as a bus stop, and we're waiting for the bus to come. l
