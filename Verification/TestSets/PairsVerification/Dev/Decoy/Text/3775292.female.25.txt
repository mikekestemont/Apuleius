get my odd little debts and credit cards paid off.  I want to live on my own and make my own way.  Naturally my mother has other ideas.  At first she wanted me to live at home with her for a year...so I could find myself.   Then when I told her that wasn't happening, she started looking at a duplex.  A duplex for my brother and I (one on each side).  I love my brother, I have no problem living near him.  HOWEVER!  I want to live on my own and come and go as I please without any of my familiy breathing down my neck.   I understand that my mother is just trying to help, but I think it is time for her to back off.  Getting over the faded romance between Jason and I is going to be nothing compared to the struggle I'm going to have shaking off my overbearing (albeit, well meaning) mother.
This break-up is one helluva ride.  I go from being incredibly hurt, feeling the full force of his rejection, to really pissed...and then I'm fine, even excited about the future...and then back to crying.  Right now, I feel okay.  Right now, I seem to have accepted the fact that Jason and I were just too different to last.  He's car shows and theme parks, I'm art galleries and historical sites.  We loved each other, and both found the differences facinating.  However, the facination wore off, and like impractical furniture, or beautifully painful shoes, the cost benefits don't add up.   Neither one of us did anything wrong, we helped each other through some tough places, we had a lot of good times, but it is time to separate.  I hope someday we can be friends.  I am excited to talk to him about what he will be up to.  I wish it would have worked out, I'm sorry if I made him feel like he had to change, but I changed too. This will be the best for both of us, just painful right now.  I hope this mood lasts.  I hope I can stick with this feeling and just let the pain fade away.  I'll find a new routine.  I'll make myself a new life.
My boyfriend, Jason, of four years broke up with me Friday night.  I've stopped crying now, but it still hurts to be alive.  It hurts to think about him, it hurts to try to curl up in bed, only to find an empty space.  I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't sit still for more than about 15 min at a time.  And when I think about him, I wonder, is he miserable too?  Why, when I was so happy, and we were talking about marriage, did he suddenly break it off?  I may never know.   Now I have to move, right now I'm living with my parents, in the house they moved into last year.  It certainly isn't my home.  Soon though, I'll get another apartment and start really moving.  Moving on with my life, without him.  A
