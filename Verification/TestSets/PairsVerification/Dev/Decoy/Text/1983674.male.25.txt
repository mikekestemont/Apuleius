you.  Let's make it happen!  Peace and love,  faux  Faux Maux   - Worthiness of mention to be determined......
I just wanted y'all to see two little sentences that appeared in an AP story today:     The city now has 4,000 fewer police than on Sept. 11, 2001, and this year New York was given $5.47 per head in homeland security grants -- the second lowest in the nation.   This is certainly pretty far from the money we were promised after 9/11. Take into account the amount of Firehouses closed and Firemen let go, we are virtually defenseless. I guess I'm going to have to don my superhero costume again. go go gadget roller skate rocket feet and omnicscience!
urlLink    Sorry I won't be there. May Bush be fucked in his ape-man skull while Cheney devours his rectum full of oil and cum with his jagged, forked Satan tongue. May Rice, the black goat of the forest with a thousand young, expose her swollen demon-goat teets, all six hundred and sixty six of them, for the horned beast Bushalathotep to suckle and know great power from its venom. May Dark Rumsfeld be devoured on the hoary alter of syphilis while the other White House Ghouls Burn one hundred dollar bills in effigy of their fallen slothmaster, AzaRagen. May the tepid lifeblood of Yog Sobush seep from the engorged genitals of Dick Cheney... Or... Heh... Uh...  Yeah...

Seems that I will not be able to go to RNC.  It's about 90% likely I will not be able to go to the party or New York, period.  This is because of my arrest.  I am dumb. I got arrested. I am going to get a stiff fine.  So... I currently cannot leave state. My court date is on the 23rd. If my case is continued, I won't be able to leave state, again, until my case is finished. Then, I have to ask permission to leave state, which they may or may not allow.  If my case is closed, dropped, complete on that date, I will have the stiff fine to pay which I will not be able to miss work because of.  I do not get paid time off. Any time I miss, I don't get paid for. A whole week is a lot of money. With a potential fine of up to $1,000 - I can't afford to miss work.  My friend that was going to drive... He's going into the hospital at the end of august to have cameras shoved down his gullet. Driving will not be something he's able to do.  Fuck, this sucks.  I hope hope hope that I am able to find a way, but as of now I am trapped.  I hope it's fun.  I love ya'll, but for now I am just a written p
