by myself on the little MX Ray ( urlLink click ) for the first time in a year and ooh it was sooo much fun!  I didn't capsize nearly as much as I thought I would (only 3 times near the end) considering the wind was so strong.  It was super annoying though because when I pulled the  urlLink spinnaker  the wind completely died and I drifted right into the shore near some dumb kids who were like 'Huh, what's that yellow thing Uncle Jim?'   We went out on the wooden boat for a good two hours and I burnt the tops of my knees something awful!  They really hurt but I  urlLink cbf  to put aloe on it.  Oh well, it'll heal.  It's not like I've never been burned before.   Also, I went buck-wild with my camera the other night and got some  urlLink pictures  that were pretty cool.  I used my step-dad's big-ass lantern and ran around in front of my camera on a tripod for 15 seconds.  Pretty fun blinding the neighbors at 10 o'clock p.m.   But I lost the original high-res of the ones I uploaded.  :(   One last thing - I'm in another  urlLink tennis  match @ BB.  Great fun, first time doing that sort.   Anyway, it's time to go home from work now.  Congrats to  urlLink Chris  and   urlLink David  for being so good at flash.  Props you guys.   -out
You know that?  It really does....  grrr..  work?  i hate it.  you can't fucking imagine.  Not only am I sick of doing all these bullshit websites, I'm sick of having them picked to destruction by my boss.  But, what are boss's for, eh?  I'll be soooo happy when I get paid to be forced to change websites..  That'll be sweet.  So then enough rant.... My site is finally starting to come together.  It looks really nice, but sorry, there's no preview :P  So far I'm at 130 or so lines of AS, and there's still more to do.  Hopefully I'll be finished with it before school starts.   Ah.  School.  It starts in like 2 weeks.  As much as I want to see my friends, I really don't want to go back.  Just like every other summer, this one has whizzed by.  Fuck.  I hate work, I really do.  I love the money, but I hate the time it takes up.  grrrrr.  Maybe I could write the fucking government and they'd pay me for doing nothing.  But then again, maybe not.  Oohhhh.. it's nearly mac time!  This friday I'll have almost enough for the computer, and then after I sell some stuff I'll have enough for the mac, dual 17" LCDs that I found on eBay, and *hopefully* a desk and a light.   Bah.  I'm tired.  I'm cranky.  And, there's a big meeting on Friday that I haven't even thought about.  Grrrrrr.  Maybe I'll call in sick on Friday... yeees, that's the thing to do!  oh my, that was like one big entire bitch session.  Oh well...  sorry for not updating for so damn long.  peace o
