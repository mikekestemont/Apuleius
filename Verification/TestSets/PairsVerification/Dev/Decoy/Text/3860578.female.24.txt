7-15-2004 My pathetic life Background – Clumsy – Our Lady Peace  It’s finally Thursday, how the days pass by so quickly. I don’t know if I should feel so happy nor should I feel sad coz of what has recently been. I’m happy coz Jae and I are in good terms right now and let’s just add that the sex last night was an added bonus. Some flaws about last night but I could easily forgive. But I know deep down inside I’m sad for Marlon. I don’t want my friend to turn out like that but I have to. Well Jae went here coz of some stupid computer glitch again. So he brought in his computer and I tried to fix it again. Well why we were hanging out in my room I was tickling and fondling him maybe I was just happy that I have somebody to share moments like such. As Jae fiddled with my phone he asked who was my ex beau that I told him the other night and he saw Erwin’s messages. Erwin was my ex beau while I was reviewing for the board exams. It was a very funny thing for Erwin was a Mechanical Engineering from UST and knowing my reputation in Engineering before at PUP that I really hated those guys from Mechanical Engineering and got into fights with them. But we were so over each other and we try to keep in touch with each other. Of course being a super seloso guy Jae wouldn’t even understand such. He would only see it as someone who’s trying to win me back to their arms. I tried to make it up to him while we were making out in my bed and though we really had our own kick just making out in my bed coz Jae doesn’t want to do it in our house which is I’m very grateful for. Well Jae has to leave already for he has to do some errands and he has to drop me off in a nearby talipapa. As I asked for my kissie he looked at me as if I was crazy knowing that there are lots of people around because of what his recent problem was he was not to be seen publicly with any girl. I was quite offended, I knew about it but that was one of out troubles before that we cannot go even to the mall just to chill out because his mom would be enraged about it. Jae has some issues concerning his love life before that he couldn’t be committed with anyone. This made me think like I had people waiting for me hand and foot just to even give them the time of day and this jerk was really acting up so much that I still talk to him? I am crazy aint i? Well my sanity holds to a string from a spider web and all I can hope for right now is to clear my mind about things to finally decide on what t
