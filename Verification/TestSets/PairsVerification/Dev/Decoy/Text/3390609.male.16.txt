yeah so aftre the wjole behind the wheel, we went to the mall. i got 2 jeans and 2 shirts for 63 bucks, not bad for AE trust me there. mom took 4ever to get into AE, i was in there waitng for at least 20 mins after i finished looking at the stuff i wanted. then to chik-fil-a, got some food. Becca' was there to and Charles. they looked to be doing good. gotta invite her over and brittney to swim sometime.  ummm then to kroger and got watermelons for the xc team and one was rotten so we got our money back. then to the post office and i sent PRIORITY MAIL to the cc camp in western virginia, they should get it wednesday. just a reminder that i'm here, and not all that happy about it.  uhhh bought a mattress comforter thingy, went home lazed round. went to xc and did hard stuff, i've done better. um still no book reading. so very sad. i have to do it so i think i'll take it with me to behind the wheel 2morrow. tired now, prolly going to bed earlier. maybe not. im hoping to get the season 4 finale farscape dvd's 2morrow. those are the LAST ONES. i'll be finsihed with farscape, until october and they do the miniseries.          church ppl i miss you, way way much.
woke up at 6:30 am for behind the wheel, the other guy driivng scares me, he can't. i ate breakfest durign our break at sheetz and then played on my cell. got my mom's phones reactivted AND we may get a new plan that gives me caller id, voice mail, three way calling, messaging. THANK GOODNESS. yea basic features i kno but ive never had em, plus free nights and i think weekends with 700 anyteime minutes a month, but hey i never use the thingy for long calls neway. plus i'd talk at night neway. umm going to mall soon to buy clothes and then gonna apply at TGIF, easy money and it's close. bye till l8er. still bummed.
caution, this post really just sucks.  Yeah pathetic post i kno, but well I am. All my friends from church left 4 camp 2day and well i hang out with em' alot and well i have my driver's thingy all week and well here I am.  They left this afternoon about 2, i stayed until they left. It was depressing. Parents were being jerks about me staying there to say goodbye, well whatever. So it's only a week so I'll see em' Saturday and all, but i'm gonna miss out on all the fun and jokes when they get back. but i'm close with em and all and i'm missing out just cause of some stupid test. uhh. im stopping this b4 i whine m
