associate with pink, but are strangely drawn to that hue of color for reasons unknown even to them. Possibly I am drawn to that color because it is the first color I was dressed in in order to be differentiated from the boys who, of course, wear blue after their first moments free of the womb. I could say a lot about my life, however why bore anyone?  Suffice it to say, I'm a girl who doesn't have anything pink. I'm a redhead which is why I don't wear pink. I work as an Event Coordinator helping brides who love pink roses. I'm married to a man who loves the color pink. I think I have said the work "pink" enough times to disolve all meaning from those 4 letters. Let's get on with the show- Tonight was our Midsummer celebration.  Midsummer is actually on Sunday, but it being Fathers' Day, I can't be in two frames of mind at once.  I can't honor the man who raised me and celebrate the first day of summer on the same day! It would be hard to be stretched so thin. Plus, Dad wouldn't understand. So, we decided that instead of celebrating on Sunday, we would celebrate today. After all, according to a friend of mine, it's the first day of summer somewhere. Just not here right now.  Why is it called Midsummer when it's the first day of summer and not the middle of summer?  I have a very simple reason for that.  I don't know.  Just 'cause.  However, our evening was very nice.  We got home from work and cooked a great dinner. We decided on an Asian theme.  After our dinner of grilled chicken, sauteed vegetables and rice, we retired to the patio and the fire pit where we finished off our (third bottle of) wine and sat and discussed the mysteries of the universe.  Tonight our universe didn't extend beyond the boundaries of the patio which contained us, but that was enough for a couple of hours of laughter and profound thoughts. I wonder if our voices echoed through our fences and if the delta breeze carried our stories to the neighbors. I'm sure they could hear every word that we said. However, I'm also sure they weren't listening.  And now, after an evening of simplicity, after good food, good wine, and good friends, I sit in front of the computer writing a blog I hope others read and my husband sits in front of the tv watching something or other.  It's funny how technology encapsulates our lives, even when we spend an evening spurning such activities. I also wonder why I am sitting here staring at this bright computer screen when I should be getting ready to call it a day well spent and get ready for the night.  I have to work tomorrow and the clock says it's after midnight. Midnight used to mean nothing to me, but now it's such an important time.  Now yesterday is done and today starts. I better get ready for i
