So, here I am sitting humming to a rough version of "Prince Charming". It's live and a tad dodgy. Just back from my first day of third year, it wasn't too bad. Not many of my friends are in my classes, but i don't have many friends in my year. Art shall be hillarious, knowing only one person in my class, you just gotta laugh. Got in my credit English and French class. Not sure about maths yet. Lets put the boring school stuff behind us.  Life is becoming to philosophical. Sometimes I wish I was waking up to my third birthday party, when life was easy and I was naive. Oh, to be naive. A wish that not many people share with me. Maybe I'm the only person in the world who sometimes just want to scream, cry and throw a tantrum when they don't get their own way. Sick of being told that I'm old enough to know, but too young to decide. Tired of being one of the girls who sit around and wait for prince charming, maybe i'll spend my whole life looking for him. Can I be princess charming? Can I save my guy? I don't want to be saved.  Thinking can't be good for me, but I do it, a lot more than the average person. Wish that my thoughts would just record themself in this blog instead of me having to recall everything.  Reminicing just makes me think of more things to write. See, even now when I was going to write about what was going through my mind today in french. I am able to write a good couple of unnecassry thoughts. Is this what makes a blog good? If so, please enter me in some kind of "Blog Award".  My mind is wondering again. Where was I? Oh yes! French.. well the fact that I happened to be participating in a french lesson is irrelevant, i'm basically setting the scene.  There I am, 2nd row from the front, rubbing my eyes. A large eyelash appears on my finger and i decide to make a wish. Usually it would be "Make so and so like me" etc etc. Today, is revoloutionary, I wished for an end to world hunger. You're probably thinking , so? It was an eyelash. This though was the first thing to cross my mind, but it lead to me thinking... when other people wish on an eyelash or say, their birthday candles...what do they wish for? A cute boy/girl to like them? To win the lottery? Most likely. What about say, world peace? An end to poverty? I doubt it. John Lennon once said "If everyone wanted world peace, as much as they wanted a new tv set, there'd be peace". These words were just a clever saying to me yesterday but today they meant something. How many times have you wanted something so bad that you'd stop at nothing to get it? If everyone wanted world peace, then we'd stop  at nothing to get it. We'd have i
