ANYONE HAVE A COOKIE? I NEED A COOKIE! Haha, yeah thats right, a cookie. Your missing out on a lot, and a great time if you have no idea what im saying. Tis a true mans sport, and girls love it ;).  It's amazing how I went from shit, crying myself to sleep, to feeling amazing once again. Can you say mood swings :P. Hopefully things stay like this for a while again, it's a great feeling wich is always greatly missed.  Haha, last night was a great time Saul. GO KERRY! We need to do shit like that all the time and work on our songs more too, it's a lot of fun. You are a great friend anyone would be honored to have. SHE CALLED THE COPS!!!!!! LOL!!!!    Lol, well this is getting kind of long so im gonna end it, peace. ;)   Quote:  "My pens paint people that ive proven wrong"  Music:  R Kelly - The Worlds Greatest  Mood:  I am INVISIBLE!
I can't remember the time or place,  or what you were wearing,  it's unclear about how we met,  all I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had,  to this day I never found someone,  with eyes as wide as yours,  I've been searching up and down this coast,  overlooking what I need the most   did you notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be   and everything else is irrelevant,  to the story so far,  a coincidence that you look like her from a far,  is it true that you like to sleep alone?  Or is it what you just tell everyone?   Did you notice that I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be   and when the world turns over  ill keep my ears to the wall  and when the world turns over  ill keep my feet straight on the ground   did u notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be
