Ok, last night my nephew J slept over since he had a dental appt to attend.  He's only in daycare- so it was no big deal to have him just hang out here with the munchkin and chill.  I woke up this morning to the noise of toys banging and my sister M telling the kids to stop making a mess.  LOL- honestly, if you're a parent or have been around small children, you know that there's really no point in asking a 2 1/2 and 3 yr old to stop making a mess.  What you need to do is make sure they clean it up after they are done playing.  Anyways, so I decided to roll out of bed  (it was 11am!) and head downstairs.  After eating breakfast- I got the munchkin ready while my sis got my nephew ready.  Once they were all showered and such, I decided it was best if me and the munchkin stay behind to wait for my eldest nephew R to get out of HS.  He also had an appt with the dentist along side his other brother K.  My sister left with J to go pick up K from preschool.  After almost getting lost, she calls me to confirm that she's got the two younger boys and is on her way to the dental office and that I'm to tell R to haul ass once he gets here to meet them on time.    Appx 2:50 he finally arrives.  I'm pretty irritated cuz he goes to school some 10 minutes away and knows damn well that he's got a 3pm appt.  Needless to say, I meet him at the door and tell him to head off to the office.  Not even a minute later, my sister calls to tell me to tell R nevermind cuz the idiot receptionist had messed up the days and set their appt for Tuesday (yesterday) as opposed to the only day R has off which is today.  So I run out..but it's too late, he's already gone.  As I'm telling my sister that he's already gone, she stops me and is yelling to the receptionist at the office...  "What did you say?  I don't appreciate your lil attitude.  That's it, let's take this outside!  Come on!"  Then dial tone.  Oh no.  I know that tone and she's pretty pissed.  I try calling my nephew on his cell but was greeted with instant voicemail.  So I call my sister back.  I find out that she's ready to beat this receptionist to a pulp and is waiting in her car for her to get off.    Apparently the girl told my sister that had she (my sister) written it down on her calendar..she wouldn't have gotten the days mixed up.  Well, it's clearly written on my sister's calendar for today, and it being a Wednesday- the only day my nephew R has off during the week, she knows that the mistake is on the incompetent receptionist.  Now you have to understand although my sister is nice person, she goes ballistic if s
