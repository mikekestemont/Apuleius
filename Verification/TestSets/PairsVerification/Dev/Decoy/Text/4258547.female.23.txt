 To have someone take something from you that you can never get back.”  Marky held up his gun and blew a hole in the mothers chest, with the little boy soon to follow. Lane,   My life is starting to make less sense than ever before.  Maybe because before I left for this place, you were my life.  Without you, my life isn’t anything but motions.  I don’t feel pain, or sorrow, or misery.  I still feel your heartbeat.  I still feel you alive inside of me.  Sometimes I don’t though.  And it scares me.  I lay in bed and I can’t hear your thoughts and I sit up in bed and cry until it comes back.  I know you say goodnight to me every night.  Your presence is around me and in me and touches everything that I do, say, feel and see. Yours,Kalli   Groaning, Dana tried to roll over, but couldn’t move.  She opened her eyes and looked around.  She couldn’t exactly make out what that was in her arm.  She tried to reach for it, but she seemed paralyzed.  She started screaming, the image of her teenager coming back to haunt her.    “Hey, quit moving!  Shut up with that fucking screaming!”  Marky leaned over and grabbed something out of a metal lunchbox.  “Here, this should shut that hole of yours up.”  Dana felt something cold go into her arm and her mind began to cloud.  She could see a tunnel in front of her.    “Stupid bitch bit me before she passed out in there, dammit.”  Marky popped open a beer as Rob stepped on the gas of their van.
urlLink    I went to high school with the two guys in the front, Nick and Tyson.  Nick was always a little punky and into music - I can remember him playing drums in band.  Tyson I don't know much about except he was kinda preppy.  I feel sorry for Nick's mother - his sister is in prison for conspiracy to commit murder or some shit, and he is in a famous band.  Two extremes - not something that happens everyday.&nbsp; urlLink
I have a friend - or at least I thought he was one of those.  I don't really know what that means anymore.  I thought it was someone you can trust.  Lately though, I am suspicious of everyone.  There is a guy at work that I really enjoy talking to.  He is brutally honest and unlike anyone else I have ever met.  He is one of the first people to not make fun of me for a being a little different or a little blonde sometimes.  What I thought was clicking was obviously something different - he was great for a week or two - and then he completely changed.  He reminds me of Oklahoma weather.  He hardley talks to me anymore and when he does, its nothing.  The whole thing was never really romantic - I just wanted someone to talk to.  Obviously, he didn't want that.  I can't wait to get out of this fucking town.  Its ridiculous h
