Dream: I walk into a club that looks not entirely unlike the Tractor, early, for an X show. John Doe is working the door.  I ask him how're things, and he decides he remembers me from the last solo show, so he ushers me in as if we're old pals. His hair looks more like Billy Zoom's, though it's John Doe color, albeit with a good deal of grey in the mix.  John Doe is not a tall man, as I've met him before and I'm taller than he, but here he towers over me, as do the bar staff and the handful of other patrons who all seem to know me.  Must be his boots , I think to myself.  He takes me arm in arm up to the bar (the place is sparsely crowded yet), and asks me what I'm having.  I can't read the labels on the taps, so he orders me a pint of PBR, and the same for himself, but he gets a Midori chaser with a nod to the barkeep. "You're gonna have to get used to meeting people, you know," John Doe says to me, "'Cause that's how it is now."  "Right on," is all I can muster. Wake.
This is the power of whatever arch demon or demiurge serves as the prince of this world: to have erected a structure and a system that serves so powerfully from earliest childhood to enslave and instill a near-autonomic reaction of fear whenever Reality asserts itself, or is suddenly revealed, thus crippling innovation, novelty, and the potential influx of Light.  All religious, theological, metaphysical, occult, even (perhaps especially) ethical arguments ultimately devolve into a dialectic of Fear versus Love, and each end of the spectrum is so intent on proving its own worth and rightness (righteousness), and thus destroying the credulity of its counterpart, that it ignores completely the creative tension in the middle -- which is precisely where Life happens, and where Spirit may most readily manifest and break through into the so-called “waking world.” Real religion, in the sense of “binding back” oneself to one’s origins (and regardless of specifics of tradition), scares the hell out of most people, as well it should.  Like the old Hebrew prophets’ visions of angels, staring one’s own soul in the face is an awesomely terrifying experience.  “And they were sore afraid.”  Damn straight they were!  To acknowledge the breadth and depth of who and of what we truly are is something for which most human beings alive today are completely unprepared.  Western culture has become a watered down mockery of itself, and by force of habit, when the full flavor is tasted on the tongue of humanity, the rational demon evokes a flight response.  Even those who have tasted Great Life in its Fullness are mostly incapable of maintaining the experience full-time, and thus tend to self-medicate with all manner of toxins and live out somnambulant lives in terror of the “vertiginous vastness” of it All.   Along this vein, Ganz, having pulled the truck over, reached into t
