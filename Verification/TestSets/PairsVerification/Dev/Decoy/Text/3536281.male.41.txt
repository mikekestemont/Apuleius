 Upon my impatient arrival in an elevator forty-one years ago, my statistics were recorded on my birth certificate alongside my name and that of my parents; and while I have changed physically, I was born a Democrat and my faith in my party and its ideals will never waiver.  Recently, out of curiosity, I checked out the Republican Party's website just to compare it to the Democratic Party's. What I found was not a mature discourse on platforms and policies, but a slamfest filled with barbs and jibes at Senator Kerry and all Democrats.  How very disappointing.  "GOP" is supposed to stand for "Grand Old Party", yet I saw nothing grand on their website. There is little, if any, information to be found on where the GOP stands. I am hard-pressed to locate real issues, serious platform data or any mature dialogue on the sorry state of affairs in which Mr. Bush has placed this once-great nation.  Conversely, what we are subjected to when going to  urlLink gop.org  is a vicious assault so sophomoric that it may well have been composed by a group of sixth-graders. Their reference to the Democratic Convention as the "Cosmetic Convention" was especially charming. Was this the idea of GOP chairman Ed Gillespie? Is he proud of his party's name-calling tactics?  The Republican Party has spent the Bush administration laying blame for this country's problems squarely in the laps of anyone but George W. Bush.  Our economy has suffered greatly in the past 3 1/2 years; yet when called to task, Mr. Bush blamed the prosperity of the Clinton administration.   When asked why more than one million Americans lost their jobs during the current administration, the White House attempted to distract us with an unnecessary war, thus making the United States the pariah of the free world.  We questioned Bush on the war, and were thrown the "weapons of mass destruction" bone.  After chewing the bone and finding no marrow, Mr. Bush's sleight-of-hand conveniently pointed us in the direction of that crafty Saddam Hussein, who obviously had his WMDs miniaturized and hidden somewhere in his spider-hole. Just add water, and  presto ! Instant WMD. Too bad this occured in the middle of the desert. Now that the vast majority of Americans are fed up with Mr. Bush keeping our troops in Iraq for no good reason, he has again pulled a quick-change and hoisted Senator Kerry (a real war hero who spent his active duty on the front lines, and not playing cards in Alabama) as his shield. Hundreds of American troops have been killed in Iraq in the past seventeen months, but that apparently doesn't matter because the RNC has another dirty, immature campaign ad to mount. Why bother with the real issues when you can fill the airwaves with lies?  I may be an American by birth and by choice, but Mr. Bush is  not  my President; and I will do everything in my power to remove him from an office he neither earned nor deserves.      SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. PLANT BUSH BACK IN T
