that it spawned a chain reaction of research and blogging to both provide a decidely geeky and relevent answer. The question comes from Sarah Davis, Modesto, CA: "I am a chemistry student and have a simple question. What is cork (chemically) and why does the wine industry assume that it is neutral enough not to effect wine's flavor"  This is a great question and not much data exists for the average person on this subject. As you may or may not know, cork consists of a honeycomb of tiny impermeable cells made from suberin, a complex fatty acid that are filled with an air-like gas. There are on average about 40 million cells per cubic centimetre of cork or around 800 million cells in a single wine cork.The suberin base is thought to be fairly inert (I would use that term rather than neutral), although they are made up of long chain polyphenolics and polyaliphatics (aromatic hydrocarbons and straight chain hydrocarbons) that "could" theoretically oxidize and deposit in wine. The compound thought to be the base structure polyphenolic is hydroxycinnamic acid which is considered totally inert because it has been polyesterized and would not be likely implicated in leaching phenolics into wine.  Suberin is another subject completely, as huge body of data exists regarding suberin chemistry and how it reacts with certain compounds. My favorite suberin reference is noted at the following site:  urlLink http://publish.uwo.ca/~bernards/temp/demystifying_suberin.pdf   The chemistry of the cork is such that the hydrocarbons are SO large and so chemically stable, that they are nearly unlikely to react with compounds found in wine (water, ethanol, glycerol etc). That is not really a good answer (technically), but I will attempt to answer with as little "chemistry geek" language as possible. Essentially, the cork is bark from a cork oak tree. This means that the suberin is created by a living thing (a tree) and thus are there for a reason. Evolution biologist suggest that cork oaks evolved due to the climate differences in Portugal and Spain. It is assumed that through the centuries, high amounts of atmospheric humidity caused the cork oaks to evolve a method to "respirate" the moisture into the tree. (again, this is an educated guess since we don't have the master plan figured out yet).  So the cork bark after harvest is cleaned, dried, disinfected and finally manufactured into corks. The suberin material while not still alive, is extremely stable (chemically), to ward off oxidizing invaders from the atmosphere. These very large chain hydrocarbons or large aromatic hydrocarbons are very difficult (chemically) to oxidize or reduce. Since wine is chemically pretty tame, the wine sits on the cork and it is believed "breathes" ever slow slightly between the cork barrier and the outside world.  Next time, we will get into the history of using cork and why it is still in use today. Until next time, cheers!
