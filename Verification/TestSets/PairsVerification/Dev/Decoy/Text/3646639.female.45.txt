ring is blue beads with two clear ones interspersed, and at the ends little silver balls; it wraps around a couple of times and adjusts to fit my finger quite nicely.  Small decorations; important messages to myself.  As is the typing; as is this room.  Messages.  Now if only I heed them!
One of those times when 3500 miles plus an ocean just add up to too much distance, and a lot of frustration as well.  I spoke to Rose yesterday; her tummy is very, very sick right now.  Which of course means she is sick right now.  It's driving me absolutely nuts.  I am worried, of course, which grows as it will to a certainty that this is appendicitis and unless she gets seen right away by a medical profession this could kill her (she loathes visits to the doctor).  I am also very angry and aware of my utter impotence and futility as I can do nothing to bring her any comfort or relief from where I'm sitting to where she is suffering.  She has a way of assuming I wouldn't want to be there when she is in any state but just fine; but of course I want to be there!  I want to look after her and see that she is as comfortable as can be; and take her to see a doctor, staying by her side so the visit is less scary for her, then bring her home and make sure she follows whatever directions she is given.  Or, God forbid, my crazy worries turn out not to be crazy, to stay with her as she goes to hospital and has whatever is needed done.  Then, of course, I would tend to her during her recuperation.  Yes, I know, I'm a complete idiot.  It can't be helped though, really.  It's the way I love her, and it's so complete it sometimes scares me.  Oh, the children have brought out the nurturing in me; I have found strength in dealing with their illnesses (blessedly few and hardly ever really complicated).  As a matter of fact, they would most likely need to be given the credit for alerting me to the softer, more nurturing side of my nature.  The side that is responding in frustration and a spark of rage at the distance between Rose and me.  Ah well.  She is all right with me not being there with her.  Which is good; the last thing she needs while feeling so ghastly is to experience frustration over distance, me, or anything else.  She told me not to expect to hear anything from her for a few days.  That doesn't make any of this easier, of course; but it does mean I need to leave her alone, because the last thing she needs when she is feeling better is droves of worrywart wordstuffs from me.  It will all go into prayer to a Third Party.  And I'll leave her alone.  And wait and worry and wonder until I hear from her again.  It's the nature of this long distance b
