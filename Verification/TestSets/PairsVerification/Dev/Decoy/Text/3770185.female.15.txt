Woke up this morning, still drunk. Got dressed and walked to the bus stop to go to work. Would have been perfectly normal but I went to the bus stop 3 hours earlier then I was sapost to. So I walked back home and the bus stop is like 8 blocks. Eventually I went to the bus stop at the right time. I had to chase after my dog who got off his leash somehow. I was working for a long time, lots of books. I hate work I never eat in the morning and form all the moving around I feel like I'm going to pass out by 5, and like an idiot I forget to bring $ for food. probably because I don't have any money! Never been paid yet! Went to the mall in my work cloths. Bought some cloths and changed into them. I helped Priya work. I made the sodas lol. Then told the guy that I was going to buy him a new rag with my first pay check. because they use the same rag that they clean the machines with to clean the counters where they make sandwiches lol. I said no wonder you got shut down twice. But my day yesterday was a lot more interesting then this one. I played roller coster tycoon 2 all morning. Did my Tao-Bo. And went to a house party at Ashley's house. Was fun a loot of people were there. I didn't want the stupid coors light so I had some gorge and orange juice, like 7 cups of it. Nick was there, he had a really funny hat and was trying to burn himself, because he's a psycho. I was soo drunk. One kid in perticular looked a lot like someone I knew (I think at least I'm not sure) but he was real cute. I was going to hook up with him, but things happen and I didn't. I unfortunately left early, my parents are so strict. Ashley didn't even show up to her own party. She did when it was almost over. I'm so going to have a house party when my parents leave!
Okay, well I joined this thing because I'm sure it's a productive waste of my time. Also it's an Xanga that my friends can't see. My week was fine. Passed all my regents, I was very surprised. I went to my math teachers and thanked them personally for there support. I went to my chem teacher and told her she was the best. But whatever The years over. I'm going to miss school. Not the learning part, but my mediators and my other friends. I will miss all the seniors who I made friends with, thankfully most of them are in a 5 block radius from me, but congratulations to them! Sophmore year was definitely the best yet. I have done many inspiring things. Class visitations, conferences, speaking at CSI and the united nations. Can't wait till next year to do it all again. And I'll have acers (or h
