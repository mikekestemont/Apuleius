better beach to go to.  It took us forever to find - one of the roads he told us to follow ended in a cemetery - and involved stopping at a random person's home for directions.  The beach turned out to be on a mill pond formed off of the river connecting to Lake Delevan.  It was really nice tough, in the middle there were giant slides and bouys to jump off of and in the sand was a volleyball court for us to play on.  We spent a couple of hours there, got sunburned, and headed back to the motel.  We took showers and naps and then headed into town for dinner.  After dinner we shopped for a little bit, bought ice cream and headed back to the motel again.  Once we got there, we decided to go swimming in the resort's tiny pool.  After that came another round of showers and bedtime.  The next morning we again skipped breakfast in favor of an early lunch of hamburgers and hotdogs.  We then packed up and half of the group headed for home.  Mike, Janelle, Alex, and I went back into town one more time and shopped for an hour or so.  Then we went home too, stopping in Elkhorn to see Alex's dad's new office and the town.
It had been a great weekend, and when I got home things kept improving.  I had received my acceptance letter into the SPA Leadership Program, which excited me very much.  Then my dad made dinner and since my siblings are gone for the week at camp, it was a quiet night with Alex and my parents.  After dinner, Alex and I headed to Barnes and Noble to pick a book I have to read for the Leadership Program.  I love going to the bookstore with him because different things tend to catch our eyes and he points out random things I may not have noticed and vice-versa and then there's plenty to talk about.  We had fun browsing for books and I finally bought the one I needed.  We headed home and the weekend was complete.
Monday was full of working and errands.  I woke up really early and was out of the door a little after 7. I was at the pool until 1 and then at Van Beck's from 2-8.  But the time really flew by and it was a pretty good day.  I got home and got a little frustrated sorting through things I need for school, but I got a couple of things accomplished.  I read for a bit and headed to bed.  Tuesday morning I got up for work and helped out at the pool 9-3.  I came home and did more college stuff and called to make a dress-altering appointment for my bridesmaid dress.  Then Alex came over and we read our seperate books - if he is there reading it keeps me focused on reading too, instead of being stressed about school.  Well it's off to bed, tomorrow will bring errands and tons of Junior Miss p
