the  munchies and end up going on the adventure of their lives as they set out  to satisfy a spontaneous craving for White Castle burgers. Ebert and Roeper  just gave our movie "Two Thumbs Up"! We hope you will too. Read on.  The opening weekend for any film is extremely important.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studio executives  (the people who make big decisions about movies) track the numbers from  that first weekend's ticket sales and make all kinds of decisions based on  that data. They decide if they will add more screens to show a film, if  they will spend more money in promoting it, if they will start investing in  a sequel... but most importantly, they decide if elements of the film work  and whether they should do it again. In our case, that means they will be  asking, "Will a strong script and story succeed or fail with 2 Asian  American guys in non-stereotypical roles?". We personally think it will  succeed, but we need your help! This film is our chance to prove that  realistic, non-stereotypical depictions can make an audience have a blast,  and take in enough money to make this happen in the future.  By buying a ticket to "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle", you aren't  just gonna get to see a really funny movie with two dudes who look like  you. Nope. You're also going to be saying to media outlets, "I support  accurate representation of Asian Americans and would like to see more." You  have the power to change things simply by buying a ticket to a film that we  believe you'll have fun watching anyway!  Please go to the theaters next weekend and watch "Harold & Kumar Go to  White Castle". We look at this awesome opportunity like we do voting in an  election. Every movie ticket someone buys is a VOTE, and the cool part is,  you're allowed to vote as many times as you want. With your support of the  film, we will show decision-makers in Hollywood that supporting movies like  these is not only the right thing to do, but is also good business. We'll  also show YOU what it's like to ride a cheetah, hang glide off a cliff,  pick up a hitchhiking Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser), tell off a bunch  of ignorant punks, get love interests, and sing Wilson Phillips at the top  of our lungs.  So just hold on for one more... week, and check out the website at  www.HaroldandKumar.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;This film opens the weekend of July 30th! Send  this email to all of your friends. Throw parties. Order food. Make a night  (or weekend) out of it and go see "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"! This  is a landmark opportunity for the Asian American community, and we are  proud to be the faces involved. With your support and the success of this  film, we hope that it's only the beginning of many more Asian Americans on  screen...  Enjoy the movie,  Kal Penn and John Cho  "Kumar" and "Harold"  New Line Cinema's "Harold and Kumar Go to White C
