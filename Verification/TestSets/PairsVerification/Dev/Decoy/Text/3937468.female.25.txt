the same town, Hemet, and the other two are only 15 minutes apart in the High desert.  This will be Super Chunk's first flight and my third. I'm not sure how fun it's going to be. Super Chunk is suffering from seasonal allergies. This has her little round nose all plugged up so everything is just going straight to her stomach. She spent most of the day with dry heaves trying to vomit up all the phlegm. This means that every time she has a dry heave she has to wait another hour before she can have anything to drink, let alone eat. The amazing thing is she doesn't even cry about it. She calls for me to come and hold her up while she gets sick but that's it. She didn't shed one single tear at all today, and it was 3 p.m. before she was able to drink anything. (She slept until 11 am then put herself back to bed at 12:30, and woke up again at 2:30. I don't want you to think I let her go all day without anything to drink while she was awake).  My girls are definitely two good little troopers. They'll follow you anywhere and be good, as long as they're not too tired. What more can I ask for?

She was tired of fighting and struggling... It seemed as if when one problem was solved, a new one arose.  Her mother calmly took her into the kitchen. She filled three pots with water, and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In the first pot, her mother placed carrots; in the second she placed eggs; and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word.  In about 20 minutes, she turned off the burners. She then fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them into a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me, what do you see?"  "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.  Her mother brought her over closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee... The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma.  The daughter then asked, "What does it mean, m
