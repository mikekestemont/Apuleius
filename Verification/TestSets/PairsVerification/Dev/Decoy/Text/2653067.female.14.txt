for us in the driveway.  In the car sat Sam, Wade and Mr. Croft.  After a long car ride, we got dropped off on the side of a curb on a street near the London drugs in richmond.  We spent some time looking through the cd's and dvd's at the London drugs store and then we walked to the mall.   The trip to the mall was quite pleasent at first.  We looked through a couple of stores and went to the chinese bakery.  Then the worst happened.  Mr. Glass, who was sitting in a strange position on a near by bench, spotted us!  It was very unexpected and I was horrified.  Sam and I peaked around the wall of the bakery as Kelsey paid for some rolls.  Mr. Glass's eyes were focused on Sam and I.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, Kelsey finished paying and we walked out of Mr. Glass's sight.  After the awful moment, we browsed through a few stores, and walked over to the food court.  A small, chocolate,  Dairy Queen Milkshake was bought (and eaten) by Sam.  The last stop was HMV.  We spent a good forty five minutes there.  In the end, Sam bought a  Guided By Voices  Cd, Kelsey bought Two Dvd's and Cd's that were $101 in total and I bought  The Velvet Underground & Nico  (see the image above).   It turned out to be a great shopping trip.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough money to buy something that I wanted so I'll have to return to the mall soon.  Hopefully I won't encounter Glass ever again.
Once again, I'm caught in another one of these love triangles. I really loathe these infernal situations. Let us go over the situation very briefly. 1-Kevan likes boy.> 2-Boy likes Julie.> 3- Julie is mad because she doesn't like these situations. You know what? Something has to be done. I'm going to end whatever the hell's going on here because I really despise this sorta stuff. Gggaaaarrrrg! New subject please!  Coincidently, I've been having conversations on msn with the one I despised so much from the last situation (such as the one aforementioned) in late may. Yeah okay.. I don't feel like talking about these "triangular love situations" because quite frankly, I don't care for love anymore. I've been in too many stupid situations.  So today I might go to the mall with Sam and Rachael. Rachael wants to get a blazer and I've got no idea what Sam wants. I will be purchasing a poster. I fear that I will never be able to hang it up on my wall due to certain reasons (It's not porn or anything).  Well I'm going to go and eat some breakfast. Bye!  Oh yeah= -I think some Kevan-Robin-Julie time will be necessary. -I hate love. -I think Vanessa knows about my "Secret purchase" (lol). ~ A-Very-Perplexed-Julie  And to "Anon.", Thanks for the advice. Yes, I will take it because it's the right thing to do and because the same thing happened to me where I was in Kevan's s
