Been a long 2 days...  Christy somehow convinced me that yesterday it would be a good idea to go to the gym at 6 am.  So I went to the gym at 6, home by 7, showered, left 15 minutes later, dropped Mom off @ work (we're carpooling these days since I'm bbsitting in Chula Vista) and went to my job.  Four hours, 2 games of tennis, and one Disney movie later, I dropped off Debbie at camp, picked up her sister from summer school, and brought her home.  Then Starbucks and lunch, an audiology appt. up North, back home for a student, then a Jewish Concert in Balboa Park @ 6:15.  As you might imagine, I basically passed out when I got home.  Sleepytime. Today I woke up and filled the car with gas, and I'm @ work right now.  Should be another fun-filled day.  Will update later.
I slept late today, which was the source of concern on the part of my mom.  My parents assume sleeping from 1 a.m. to 10 a.m., eating breakfast, then going back to sleep for an hour means I have an iron deficiency or I'm depressed or something.  I'm just tired.  Period. Cleaned house, then headed over to visit with Julia and Aunt Jody.  She leaves for Israel in a couple of days, and I am really worried for her safety.  It's a dangerous place.  Then Chinese food and Pistachio yogurt. Off to see the world in my dreams.  Work tomorrow a.m., should be fun babysitting.  woopee...
I just returned from the movie, "The Notebook".  What amazing acting! I was very impressed by the music, too, although the editing left a bit to desire.  The whole 365 love letters story was very endearing- what it must be like!  It seems like such an incredible era to live in. Also went to the fair today.  Not much to say, spent a lot of money, did many things.  Not so impressive, but good excercise between the walk to the car and the people I had to shove my way thru.  Oy. Looking forward to a quiet tomorrow.  P.S. 5 year anniversary of my Bat Mitzvah today!
It's official: I'm lazy.  Woke up at 9:30 this morning only to realize that my gym buddy was grounded, and that I couldn't gather up enough courage to go it alone in the cold, sweaty and very unfamiliar territory.  So, what did I do all day?  I cleaned. I slept a few hours this afternoon, woke up when my mom came in, and shipped out to Grossmont to meet some buddies for "Farenheit 9/11".  The 7:30 was, of course, sold out, so we bought tickets for the 10:15 show and grabbed dinner at Chevy's Mex.  I saw some old friends, who were great fun to chill and boosted my social confidence level a bit.  The movie theater then restored most confidence in the La Mesa community- so many liberals in one place, and you know what?  I literally knew a third of them all personally, including one older cousin. Once again, M
