The Resident Evil spoof script is now finished, & the whole thing will hopefully be shot on tuesday, if not this week, then next tuesday. for the sake of copy rights the name has been put as Occupant No Good instead of Resident Evil: The Gretna Outbreak. So as I said, if you know who i am, make sure you get in contact with me if you want to see this when it is finished.
So lately, ive had a few friends, or a friend, who has turned into a major DICK. Most people just complain about him, or make dumb threats at him, but if he continues on his path, I may have to resort to...                VIGILANTE JUSTICE   Pretty much meaning, that if he keeps this up, i'll kick his ass back to new mexico... And that is what i call the darker side of good!
Today was my last day as a junior in high school, but thats not the focus of my entry tonight. Neither is it that we finished the script to my movie. The focus is..... MY MOTHER!      Most days...I love her, other days (such as the last 2 weeks of my life) I either want to smash something (or someone in that case) or move out as soon as I can because of her. She has made my last to weeks into HELL!She was upset about my girlfriend & my actions. SO she has (at least what it seems to me as) pushed us almost to the brink of ending the whole thing, & if that were to happen, there would be hell to pay for a very very very long time. So for the last 2 weeks: Mom has been mad at me, My girlfriend has been mad at me (off and on), my girlfriends mom is mad about the whole thing, & my brothers are mad at me cuz im mad at them. Then here in the middle are me and my dad... 2 men against 3 women & 2 boys, Not even near being fair. Plus im working 2 to 10 every nite every week so im very tired along with this whole deal, not cool.
So a few of my friends & I are gonna get together & make a spoof of the Resident Evil game series, we plan on making it around 90 minutes long, w/ 20 somethin scenes. We spent around an hour & a 1/2 today planning out the first 10 scenes.       I'll post more info when it gets finished, so for any of you dementoids that know me, you can get a hold of me & have me show it to you.
