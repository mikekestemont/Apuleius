Went to my grandma's house today swam in the pool! Always fun. My face got pretty sunburned but oh well what can ya do? We picked my cousin Jayce up on the way out to my grandma's so that was fun haven't seen her in a long while. I practiced for my Deep water upgrade (which is tomorrow) in the pool. I found a brick and treaded water with it for as long as i could, i think about a min or 2. Then i practiced my laps (not hard at all) and then my cousin Katy came back with my grandma from the beach and she helped me practice gave me a few pointers, helped me out a little. Then i layed around for a while worked on my tan for a bit, went back in the pool and played toothpaste with the little bros and cousin. Fun Fun Fun. Swimming is fun except now my eyes are like freakin burning. Had a good day, I'll write some more later tonight. SUMMERLAND tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
