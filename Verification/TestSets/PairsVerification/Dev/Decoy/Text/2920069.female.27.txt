oooh. the morning after. i hope art is gentle. tell rollins i'm sorry, but sofie and i got invited to another keg party just down the road in matunuck. anyway, congrats on a job well done...  now let the REAL work begin.
T minus 5 hours. you're SO not thinking about mondrian. i realize this, and do not necessarily expect that the majority of you will be able to speak coherently this afternoon. maybe i wil be pleasantly surprised. also, the syllabus is about to go to crap for the sake of fun and interesting projects that have been brought to my attention. i heart n.y.

good afternoon children! hope all is going well with your portfolios. well, you'll be glad to know we were both down in the mud today... you figuritively and me litterally. the magic of a poorly drained site, but that's for another class and another teacher. have you ever heard the story about the portfolio faerie?
