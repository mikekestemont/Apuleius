I'm just sitting here thinking about how good God is to me. He's become a Friend to me. One that cares about every tiny detail in my life.   It still amazes me that despite all that I've done in my life, and I've done some horrible things, He still loves me and wants to call me 'friend'.   All the times I've cursed him... All the times I've cursed others... All the times I've made decisions based on my own selfish desires... All the times I've rejected Him... All the times I've ignored Him... All the times I've walked away from Him... All the times I've neglected my relationship with Him...  It's all in the past, and despite all that I've done, He wants to have a relationship with me. He loves me so much...   I never really give that enough thought, honestly. The God of the Universe... Maker of all that we see and all that we don't see... The One whose spoken words formed it all... He who transcends time, space, and everything else we don't know about... He cares enough for me, that He robed Himself in flesh, lived life as a lowly man, and died a horrible death ending on a cross suspended in mid air... for me. Not only did He do all that, He did it because my own sins required it. He took my place. I drove the nails into his hands. I am the reason He hung there...   What love... What undeserved Love!    No one shows greater love than when he lays down his life for his friends .  You are my friends  if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant does not know what his master is doing.  But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father .  You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you . I have appointed you to go and produce fruit that will last, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.  ( John 15:13-16 ISV )  Thank you Jesus, for calling me Friend! I love you Lord!

Ok, so I figured it was time to join the rest of the world in their pursuit of blogs.   Here's my very first entry...   Blog blog blog.  Done for now.  :)
I really have no&nbsp;affection for politics, or politicians. I love the men and women in politics, but I don't like their ways.   The DNC has been going on in Boston for a few days, and last night Kerry took the stage and delivered his 'most important speech of his life' as one news commentator mentioned. Gimme a break... he's said the same things everyone running for p
