I watched him poring over the selections on his menu, his eyes stopping at each item and narrowing slightly as he analyzed it, trying to decide if it would be safe, then flicking down to the next choice. I wondered what he was thinking. Was he trying to find things that were simple and relatively unmessy to eat? Whatever it was that was going through his mind, it was interesting to watch his eye movements. They would move away from one item, and then return to it before moving on to the next. Then they would move back.“Do you always have so much trouble making decisions?” I asked.“I don’t think I’ve ever had so much to think about in reading a menu,” he said.Finally, he closed the menu and raised his eyes to mine. I smiled, and we waited for the waiter to return. I gave my order first, then we both turned to him to see what he had decided. Salad with no dressing, a steak, and a baked potato with butter.“Very safe, but a little boring,” I said.“This is anything but boring for me,” he said.I reached into my purse and pulled out something bright fluorescent green, rolled and tied with a pink bow.“Put this on,” I said, handing it to him.Slowly, he untied the bow and unrolled the item I had given him. His expression was priceless as he realized that it was a rather large, plastic bib, with a picture of a pink pig in the center of it. He smiled, almost laughed, as he looked up at me. But I wasn’t smiling, now.“Well, put it on. Now, before our food gets here,” I said quietly, but firmly.He seemed to freeze. I could see in his eyes that he was reluctant, but he sort of drew in a deep breath, let it out, and slipped the straps over his shoulders and tied them behind his neck. He looked hilarious as he sat there with his hands in his lap with this bright pink and green pig bib sitting on his chest. And then the waiter arrived with our food. To his credit, he didn’t even crack a smile, but he did seem excessively intent on getting the plates on the table as quickly as possible. I assumed he went back into the kitchen to burst into laughter. The waiter wasn’t the only one to notice the bib, either. Heads were turning toward us from all the tables around us. I guess they’d never seen a grown man in a piggy bib before.But now, I began talking to him about us. I told him what I was looking for, and I asked him very pointed and serious questions about his feelings about being dominated. And, to his credit, he seemed able to think clearly about his answers, despite the fact that he was more or less the center of attention in our part of the restaurant. And he ate with as much dignity as possible for a man in his predicament. He kept the bib on throughout t
