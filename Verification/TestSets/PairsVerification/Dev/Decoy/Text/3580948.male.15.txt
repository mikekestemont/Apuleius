My cousin got caught sneaking out last night. I was suppose to go with but i needed my sleep. I also had a feeling that something was gonna happen. He took out his brother's new camry and drove it at like 1 or 2 in the morning. He picked up two of our other friends and drove to saratoga to see his potential gf. haha. Before he snuck out of his house, he was in the backyard and the birds in the backyard started squealing which woke up his brother to find his car missing. He went to check up on his brother and thought he was sleeping but it was just pillows. They called the cops to report a missing car. i can't anything else or they will use this as evidence...hahahaha
I got caught going out yesterday. I asked my mom if i can go out with my friends to the movies but she said no and had no reason for it, well she did say i would get addicted to going out, but i won't. The only reason i want to go out is so i don't have to listen to my mom nag and complain and yell at me for stupid things like cleaning my room. It's not about going out, its more about having freedom. I'd rather stay home all day home alone than have someone else in the house yelling at me for things to do. Anyways...heres the story:  I was going on a second date but this time my friends were going too. We wanted to watch white chicks since it would come out that day. The movie started at 2:15 and it would be an hour and 45 minutes long. I thought i would make it home on time before my mom but i forgot that she didn't need to pick up my sister from work and so she came home and didn't see me. We finshed the movie and came out to see that the time was 4:15. I was scared. First, i felt stupid asking my sister's friend for a ride but he lived close i guess..Then i was afraid of my mom yelling at me in front of my friends. Our ride came to drop everyone off at my house. I come home to see that my mom wasn;t home. YES! so i hurried to call my cousin and tell her to whoever that asks that i was at her house with my friends and that we came home at 4. My friends stay until 6 and thats when my mom came home to pick me up to go to my cousin's house to eat dinner. She asked where i was because she called home and no one picked up and she came home and didn't see me home. I told her that i was at my cousin's house. She knew i lied. XP. We drove my friend home and she told me that she saw my cousin at Costco...do'h. She wanted to seem more like a bigshot and so s
