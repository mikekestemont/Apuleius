favourite boys made, a volcano I would say, rather than a piece of chocolate. We all had a good laugh for the chocolate we made. TOO bad I didn't bring my DC.   My students promised me to send me the pics they had taken but I only received one......
I always do self contradictory things......  I had had a piece of delicious fatty blue-berry cheese cake before I worked out hard this afternoon.   I spent a lot after I have promised myself to save money.  I remembered the last literature course I have taken in  urlLink my beloved university , twentieth century fiction. We deconstruct some norms and believes before we can build up the new order. Do I have to put more fat in my tummy before I finally 're-realize' the urge to  lose weight? Do I have to wait until I receive the credit card statement before I finally 're-realize' I am nobody except a big pile of clothes, bracelets, earrings and skincare products?   A super strong belief must be presented in order to help me to skip the deconstruction step and jump to the new order building step......
It was the graduation ceremony. I was a bit pissed off as my help was not appreciated. Anyway, shouldn't be bothered by such trivial stuff.  I gave tuition today. Re-realize a very important quality of mine. Really like the idea 'You never know if you never try'.
What a wonderful and exciting night! A must to write it down!
It is the reunion day of HKSAR. To me, it's just an extra holiday. This extra holiday is a headache day for the government as there was a demonstration. The organization body claimed more than 510,000 went demostration under the hot sun.   As my father usually says, politics is a dirty game. The further you stay away the better.
This is my favourite Cantonese song which was sung by Anita Mui. The lyrics is really something. Let me try my best to translate it into English. For those bilinguals, don't laugh at me!   抱緊眼前人   Hold you tight     本應相愛本應相襯, We should be a perfect couple 命裡注定同行卻未能, But fate doesn't put us together 捨不得不愛把不得一世, I will regret for not loving you with the span of forever 唯願抱緊眼前人。 With such an arrangment, my only wish is to hold you tight 匆匆一世深深一吻, Maybe a passionate kiss is the only eternity you have ever had 就此以後無從愛別人 I will have to learn how to love again 若只得今晚可偷偷走近, If we only have tonight, why don't we stay closer 誰又理得天鎖禁。 and ignore the fate? 愛你就算將跌入永遠黑暗, I love you even though I may fall into eternal sorrow 但這一刻抱緊, But the solid hug 多麼確實無用再覓尋。 tells your heart you can stop looking around 浮沉人在世快樂循環又傷心, We live in a cycle of happiness and sadness 但願愛得最動人。 I just hope our hearts touch 一宵的愛一生的印, The night is a seal 儘管最後如同過路人。 though we may end up like strangers 捨不得不愛巴不得一世, I will regret for not loving you with the span of forever 唯願抱緊眼前人。 With such an arragement, my only wish is to hold you tight
