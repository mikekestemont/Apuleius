I recently helped a german friend of mine put together a  urlLink website  for his new business and he sent me a care package as a way of saying thanks. got a full supporter kit for FC KOLN including: jacket, scarf, and flag plus an Fortuna Dusseldorf flag and mousepad. a few german beers and some chocolate. not everything survived the ham hands at customs and the us postal service as evidenced by this poor Milka bar (yes that green hue is some kind of fungus, plus half the bar is fucking missing).
off-roading in the Honda was not a good idea. the car broke down, power steering hose burst earlier in the week. managed to get that fixed and some other things repaired as well but there is still quite a rattle from something underneath of the car. I have a feeling that the catalytic converter is trying to separate itself.
just got home from StarScape (a rave up in balitmore). was there for exactly 12 hours. Didn't even have a single beer, too poor :( had an awesome time, except for the rain. now its off to bed until Monday.

Bobo Smash! My car.

sorry about that last outburst...lady green's place of employment has added blocking software, so she is no longer able to directly access bobosmash (according to them it's pornography). lady green didn't know that bobo was a pimp daddy  :) she has also had problems posting to her blogs. this sucks ass. fuck the man!

back home from a rainy week at Ocean City. got one nice day and that was it. highlight of the trip was the constant supply of dead fish washing up on shore.  hey, i stepped on something squishy, is that you ham-hands? no, its a dead fish under the ocean. Swimming is f
