Hey, everyone! I made this journal so I could put posts up on my sister's Blog, which is basically a shrine to her baby, (Christian) Nick. My day at school was pretty good. Everything is so busy---sometimes stressful---at this time of year. Signing yearbooks, planning summer excursions, cramming for finals, saying goodbye to friends who are going away for the summer, etcetera. Also, this is your last chance at doing something in middle school...once we get to high school, the bits run up. If you have one last thing you have to do, someone you need to make amends with, a teacher you want to thank, a boy you want to confess your love to (not in my particular case, but for a lot of my friends)--well then now's the time. High school will be a whole new ball game!  I'm excited for ~**Summer 2004**~  Hope to see all of you, have a lot of time to hang out, and mostly... NOT BE GROUNDED!!   Gimme a call everyone!  728-1361   **Keely**
(Verse 1] It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby I ain't happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Bridge] I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)   Some of the lyrics to Usher's "Burn" that remind me of someone....movin' on :) I'm so ready for summer and high school and I'll never have to see him again!  **Keely**
I just read a great book,  tuesdays with Morrie  It was amazing! I spent my entire morning just reading it. It made me cry, and rethink a lot of stuff in my life... Soccer tonight...I'm excited...I hope our winning streak holds out...if not, I'll be kinda cranky, since I'm sacrificing a lot of time on soccer this season....almost every day!   Love, Keely
Cause these are the days worth living, these are the years we're given, and these are the moments. These are the times. L
