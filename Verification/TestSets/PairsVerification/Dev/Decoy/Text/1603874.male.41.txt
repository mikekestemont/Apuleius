 It further states that they've had to buy  urlLink M-16  ammo from their NATO buddies.  Fortunately (iirc) the Brit  urlLink SA-80  fires the same round, so they have some rounds to spare.  This goes back to hardware chip designers:  always have two plants to make your chips so if one has problems you have a fallback.  Reminds me of an old 'nam joke:   Got some  urlLink ARVN  rifles.  Never been fired and only dropped once.
Phone call?  What phone call?  No call, no message.  Why am I not surprised?
This is X, is this Y?   Yes, I am.   Are you free to work on job Z now?   Yes.   Well, I have a client who wants someone who can do Z.   Could you be more specific about Z, because Z is complex?   Err, no I don't have the job description from the client.   Well, I can't answer your questions without more detail.   I'll have the job description, tomorrow.&nbsp; Can I call you?   Sure.    What a  fucking waste of time  with an incompetent  fool .
And no, I don't mean the game.  The  debt spiral  has finally got me in its clutches and the way out is  less than obvious .  I blame the final nail on Laura Creighton  urlLink &lt;lac@strakt.com&gt; .  This deluded individual has cost me more than 30 000 &euro; and threatened to fire me if I asked an organisational question (again) after working for  urlLink AB Strakt  for a month or so.  Following that incident she underwent psychiatric treatment.  I just walked back into my office and wondered  what the fuck am I doing here ?  I probably put  urlLink Van Halen  on and stared into my monitor.  As for the 30 000 &euro; (very much on the low side)?  I asked for it and it was refused.  Lawyers?  I can't afford 'em.  Freedom of Speech?  I have that in two countries and I'm exercising it.  Expect a  sitrep  late next week.
En ce moment, sur le plan budgétaire, vous avez plutôt tendance à manquer de discernement, boyd . Côté finances, apprenez à dire non aux sollicitations que l'on peut vous faire. Vos projets professionnels ou un achat inopiné pourraient vous poser problème. Vous devez donc, trouver séance tenante, le moyen de faire des économies. En effet, des mises à jour s'imposent sur le plan financier...
I have tried to  typeset  various documents using various  urlLink &mu;$loth   turds  tools [Wordpad, Word] and each time, without fail, WISINWIFG [What I See Is Not What I Fucking Get]!!  This  will  not do.  And, no, it's not my eyesight.  So, once I have  regained composure  I will rewrite my CVs in  urlLink troff(1) ; a 30 year old piece of software that always gets it right.
Given this  urlLink thing  was created by an  urlLink exception , judged in private by a bunch of exceptional Swedes and presented by The Monarch of Sweden [another exception].  I'd just like them to explain it to me how this sits with  urlLink Jantelagen ?  Just how  noble  is that?
But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him .
