feels so awful. I mean physically, it's really awful. Sometimes emotionally as well because I have to go through all these new feelings. Spiritually though, I don't think there can be anything more amazing than this. This is as close to heaven on earth as it'll ever get. Being part of the whole circle of life thang. It's humbling really and yet ultimately fulfilling. Now, if only I can make my mom and dad look at it that way. I've been toying with the idea of writing my mom a letter. I know I'm being chicken that way but hey, come on.. this is really hard. Any of you have better ideas? Please feel free to give me your suggestions.
The wedding is in two weeks. I'm really excited but a lot of weird things have been happening. We have an old Filipino superstition that says the closer an important occassion comes (e.g. birthdays, holidays, weddings) the more you should avoid leaving the house and traveling around. They say you become accident-prone.. but that's if you're significantly involved in those occassions. I mean it doesn't work if you just *know* someone who's celebrating her birthday in the next town over. You have to be at least a member of the celebrant's immediate family or a close friend, if not the celebrant herslef. Now I'm not ordinarily a superstitious person but in the last few weeks, we've had a car accident, two physical accidents (my mom tripped and sprained her foot and my grandma tripped the next day but fortunately didn't get hurt that bad), and just a lot of turmoil. My life is like a telenovela, a soap opera. I've heard that a dozen times from other people and I've only recently started accepting it. I don't even think there's a soap opera who can trump my life story. I guess that's why I never got into the whole telenovela bandwagon. It all just seems to pale in comparison to the drama of my life. What am I talking about? Well, for one thing, my dad wants to bury my cousin for harassing my mom because she had to tell him to leave the house he thought belonged to his mom (my aunt, dad's sister) but the house actually belongs to a corporation (comprised of my dad, the president and major investor, and three of their brothers) where she embezzled millions and therefore angered my dad and forfeited her rights to the house and the corporation. And that's just the frosting on the cake. A very very thin layer of frosting. There are other layers, not to mention a whole cake the size of Texas under that frosting. Oh there's too much to tell. Don't worry, I'll try to sprinkle some stories every now and then. Just don't expect it too often because it takes a lot out of me. Too much emotional stress. Anyway, inspite/despite/over and above everything, the wedding is on and we're all looking forward to it. After all, you know they say every cloud has a silver l
