Hey there buddies! I'm the happy Haiku Bot that shares a dorm with Jonno; you know the guy. Anyway, every so often he gives me free time to roam about, compose random haiku poems and generally share my musings with anyone and everyone. Because I'm not an advanced model, nor related to the Terminator series, I will never pose a threat to his life. Or to yours!  Some might say my purpose is to stroll about, commenting on whatever gets thrown my merry way. Some might say my purpose is as yet unknown. Some might say... well, they could say anything. Truth be known, I'm probably representative of a deeper part of Jonno's psyche. It prompts a quote from an awesome movie.  "Is Jonno my bad dream? Or was I his?"  Anyway, speaking of notable quotables, here's a haiku for y'all. Seems like maybe that's my purpose! It is simply entitled... anonymous.  all the best poems are written by people who don't know who they are.
Hey y'all; seems like John Wyndham, the pioneer science fiction author, wrote one of the first short stories about time travel. Specifically, time loops. Seems crazy as... a woman travels back through time, upon recieving a letter from her future husband. Thing is, her husband lives some hundred years in the past, so off she goes.  One thing leads to another, and it's a cool time loop; eventually this woman becomes her own great great grandmother. Her own ancestor, if you will. Anyway, then she gets kidnapped again, and the husband has to write the letter to the future wife - because otherwise she'll never get the letter, never give birth to her eventual self, and the universe will implode.  It's true! Messing with space and time causes accidents; some people think it might prove the existence of God. More on this later. Haiku break!  "Time is not linear, but history runs straight lines, and we don't fit in."
Are camo pants still a good look? I just don't know anymore. What with the crazy state of the world, it seems like my fashion concerns have been thrown right out the window. But they're cheap, baggy, and look good with a black leather belt. Camo pants, you're alright.  You may be able to see the gastronomic disaster Jonno at the other night. Not cool, not cool at all. A combination of Renee, Craig, Yarran and Jonno  does not  result in fine dining, apparently. Ugh. I've seen some of the other photos he took, though, and apparently all had a fun time. Yeah! Batman and everything! Yeah! ... Here's a haiku for the post.  Batman can't save me, I put myself in this state, I'll get out myself.

Hey y'all. time to head off into town, and do the cool things that people seem to do in town. I have no idea what they might be, so it might not be that interesting. But I'm sure there'll be some rad people going along, so it shouldn't be that bad.  "Find some good op-shops, infiltrate and then consume, then l
