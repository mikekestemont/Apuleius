Here is a picture of the Turkish equivalent of FDR, Thomas Jefferson, and Ronald Regan combined.  The great Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who was a fierce general and an even better statesman. His refroms included the adoption of the Roman alphabet, secualrism, and the first quasi-democracy in the Middle East. Really a fascinating and inspiring figure, as well as a great uniter (except to some of the Kurds).&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
Asli, Nazli, Dehan and Seda from left to right. Wonderful women who made the transition easier for this infidal who moved to Turkey alone. I will always remember out work meetings fondly and our birthday celebrations. I only wish we all could have gotten to know Michael better.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
Feryal and Emel. Very funny women and when it comes to shopping...well they can give any lady a run for their money.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
