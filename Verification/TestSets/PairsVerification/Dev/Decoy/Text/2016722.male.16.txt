Chemistry "class" just ended early, it is now officially spring break for my online school. But the break doesn't line up with our Italy trip... so I have to work ahead. Bleh. Class was boring as usual, the teacher just went over what we read in the textbook, so during the time I read all of Katha's blog, including one of those gazillion question quizzes. It must've asked "are you gay?" a hundred times.  I had my lesson this morning, it went pretty well except for the fact that the new pianist couldn't read Beethoven's Spring violin sonata. I don't blame her, the piano part is like a concerto, just much more transparent. Anyhow, Alice probably won't hire her. After my lesson I feel like I can do anything, the weekend is here and there's nothing stopping me from doing anything I want. Then Thursday shows up again and I've only practiced like.. 3 hours all week. I guess I haven't wanted to be a musician that badly. Maybe I do, but these are the years where you can't mess around. Anyway...  It's rather unorganized right now, but it sounds like some people from the RPYO group might go to Suzannah (opera) tonight. I heard that my neighboor's daughter made the set or something, so my parents are being goody-goody neighboors and going to show their support. I should call up various people and see what we're doing.
As I was waiting outside of Eastman I heard some guy talking to another in a loud, know-it-all voice: "I really want to learn about Asian culture. I mean, come on, corporate America is trying to americanize Asia." True. But also: 1. This guy was a dumbass, you had to be there 2. America IS corporate, sure there's bad people in high places, but the root of America lies in the fact that people work for themselves, therefore forming businesses. Some would call this capitalism. Hence, a corporate America. 3. Asians don't have to go to McDonalds. The communists aren't shoving French (oh, freedom, sorry) Fries down their throats. 4. This guy thought he was cool cause he was hanging around Eastman/Java's. Hope he gets hit up by a beggar. That's what he wants, no corporate America, just lots of people begging for stuff. No corporate America, but he definately wants money to be cool and hang around Java's.  rrrr.
My audition for the string orchestra concerto went pretty well I thought. The piece isn't that hard, and I've only practiced it a total of 4 days or so, but I had a lesson on it a few weeks ago which was good. Its also short. You realise how short it is when you actually audition. I'm not getting as nervous as I used to, I'm getting out of the teenager anxiety stage.  Madama Butterfly is so beautiful. My view of music was so messed up when I was younger. I would have called something like Madama Butterfly or somehting from an even earlier period "modern". I thought the Mendelsohn String Octet was modern t
