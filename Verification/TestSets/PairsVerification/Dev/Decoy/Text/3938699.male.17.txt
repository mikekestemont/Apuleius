selfish is worthwhile.&amp;nbsp; Yet, in a world where that is but the norm, what good is it?&amp;nbsp; I ask for justification of my own actions.&amp;nbsp; Someone explain to me why I dont go out and have fun like the rest.&amp;nbsp; Why do I not do these things when I am not a role model.&amp;nbsp; When my actions are not regarded highly in any form or fashion.&amp;nbsp; Why carry this cross, that so many others have abandoned?&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm wrong.&amp;nbsp; Maybe going out, becoming intoxicated and making out with some person you just met is holy and moral.&amp;nbsp;    Maybe everything I've ever lived my life for is but a deception.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Love is just some insipid invention.&amp;nbsp; Some febel construct of a weak human intelect.&amp;nbsp;    But maybe I'm right.&amp;nbsp; I just want to know why I am, and what worth it is to be right.&amp;nbsp; What good is a Paladin when his castle crumbles around him?&amp;nbsp; What good is an ethical person when ethics cease to be?      Do you believe you're fighting for something...   &nbsp;  Waltz for Venus... - 5/26/2004  I sit here at my computer gazing at His Dark Materials.&amp;nbsp; A Trilogy I recently purchased at the inspiration of my friends Jake and Nathan.&amp;nbsp; I can recall, last year Jake having just finished reading it, explaining what a great trilogy it is, how it has a fantastic love story.&amp;nbsp; Once more I gaze at the books, and above the title it clearly displays the books' genre.&amp;nbsp; 'Fantasy'.    It's all, just a dream.&amp;nbsp;    Love, that ever elusive Unicorn.&amp;nbsp; Just over the horizon.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is just a fantasy.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this journey has been nothing more than an Odyssey without an Ithaka.&amp;nbsp; So I sit here, staring blankly at my computer screen, words appearing at my very will.&amp;nbsp; Only words.&amp;nbsp;    Not everyone gets married.&amp;nbsp; Not everyone finds love.&amp;nbsp; Few I suppose do.&amp;nbsp; How lucky they must be, do they even realize it?&amp;nbsp;    Again I see people who are constantly in a relationship, rarely with the same person.&amp;nbsp; Does that mean anything?&amp;nbsp; Is that love, does that make them happy?&amp;nbsp; It wouldn't make me happy, that much is true.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the void would be filled, but with each passing girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; With each passing love, that void would only swell.      See you space cowboy...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;
Today at work (Nesbits today), I realized just how much I hate my last name.  Honeycutt.  It's hard not to make fun of that name.  My friends all have cool names.  Cooper, Thompson, Hartman, etc.  The only insult for cooper is poopers cooper, which was uttered by Alice McDonald, only because everything she says needs to be accompanied by one.  Because all she says is s**t basically.   So this big black lady goes, 'hey bryan... uh, honeycomb?  Uh, honeysomething?'.  I hate myself.  And i'm putting up all these clothes that belong to people with freaking awesome last names.  I'd give an arm and a leg to have names like some people have: Valore, Machines, Terranova.  Freaking awesome names.     I am forced to live in perpetual angst and self h
