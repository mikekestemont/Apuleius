Day3(the Final Day)  Once again Todd woke us up at 6:30, grrrrrrrrrrr, we packed up, went to eat in the cafeteria. The guys got together in the gym for like an hour.

So he waited 3 days. He eventually cut his arm off w/a sharp rock. it took him HOURS! but he lived because he loves life so much, his arm means nothing. After that we headed over to the Conference. We had the worst seats! but it was ok. We sang praise and worship, by now i was beat. i was tired as i could be, and my clafs hurt from jumping. Then Mass started it was ok until the homily, geeze the guy could talk for forever! lol but it was soon time for communion. but during the blessing of the host, a girl was rendered unconcious by the holy spirit...in regular day MASS! how power is God...wow...haha...but she was unconcious for like 20.
