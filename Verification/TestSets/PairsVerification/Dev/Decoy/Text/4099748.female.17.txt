talk to me so much, I was surprised I found him so intriguing and funny. I was shocked he was so open and vulnerable. I had walls up for miles, and although he had been hurt more times than I could imagine, he opened himself up to me. There was one point, we had become close, he was open and I could see he really cared about me. At that moment, I knew I would either push him away as I had done to every other man, or I would accept and love whatever person his blonde, six-foot frame contained. I knew it would be easy and natural for me to push him away and never give him another thought. For once, for the only time, it was different. This was not just some guy trying to get me. He cared about me, and there was something between us . . . something I'd never experienced before. We completed each other, we had something the other desired and wanted. At that point, I needed him. So although it was new and uncomfortable, I made a decision that I knew I had to stick by. A decision I knew I would need to explain and that may cost me. Perhaps very much.  Love is stronger than death, it's jealousy unyielding as the grave.  That's a blessing and a curse, but I was yet to find out.    He started coming to church. He became a Christian. Kristina plastered me with questions, do you like him? Do you think he's cute? You guys do look really cute together . . . We tried to hide it, I was embarrassed. Soon everyone knew. No one mocked me, no one told me I'd gone against my word. Everyone was happy for me, everybody was interested in us. We had our ups and downs, but we loved each other. I had the constant thought of him going away. Which he eventually did. He gave me his ring, which he always wore. I was shocked, I didn't think he would, but when he did, I knew he would come back to me. He will be gone for as long as we were together. The time is just about over. We had our ups and downs, too many. He eventually did something that really hurt me, and it was more than enough for me to make a change. I know I hurt him, too. I wasn't myself for him, I never showed him what I was really thinking because I didn't want to hurt him.  This way still hurts.  He is my hero, have you ever lost a hero?  Yet we decided that we need to take a break and get some healing. We still love each other, and I am as enamored with him as ever. We want to learn to have a friendship, then see if we can build upon a firm foundation. All I want is a healthy relationship that will last forever. The man of my dreams . . . don't let me lose h
