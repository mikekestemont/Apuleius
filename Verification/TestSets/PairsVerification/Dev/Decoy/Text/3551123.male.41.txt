He jerked his overweight SUV in and out of traffic like a top, the vehicle straining against the centrifugal force from the abrupt moves.  It was another one of those mornings, why couldn’t that bitch just shut up?  He reflexively reached to his top left pocket for his smokes which was about the only pleasure he had left in life, and then realized for the third time in the ten minutes he had been careening down the highway that he smoked his last one in the kitchen, thrusting it in the air to accentuate his point, he had to get his point across, because God knows if he didn’t beat it into her head she wouldn’t understand a damn thing.
