her life.  53 kids got saved total, out of 75 in attendance, 10 of whom were my helpers.  What was incredible was that most of the kids at the cursade came from Stonegate and Hospital Heights, the 2 neighborhoods in which we do Metro Kidz. When I first came here, I figured I would be a dream center intern, and run Metro Kidz in Hospital Heights and that was it.  Boy was I wrong.  I had no clue how God would enlarge my heart towards our community.  I can't imagine not doing this now.  I used to question whether or not I even wanted to do ministry full time because I wanted to live more for me.  I thought that would make me happier, yet I am happier now than ever.  Focusing on others makes it so my issues seem so small.  I know that my strength only comes in my weakness, so that Christ's strength can be made perfect in me.  That is the only way I can do what I do.     We're living a dream!!!!!!
This weekend was another "God" weekend.  Well, it's all God's anyway.  It's just that sometimes I actually REALIZE that and give Him what's His already.   Anyway!  I was supposed to have gone to the Gig like usual, the radio show we do on Sat. nights, but God had other plans.  I couldn't even tell Rob I wasn't going without breaking down into tears.  (SUCH a girl!)  But, I did.  And God was there.  I did nothing that night other than play my keyboard and do a ton of worship.  At one point, I had to even stop that.  There was some worship music in the CD player, so I let God do what He wanted and laid down on the floor, spread-eagle, and waited.   Man, did He ever tell me some things.  Keep in mind, I didn't let them go into full effect until mid-Sunday.  Point is, they were spoken into me on Sat. night, then God started RAINING DOWN!!!!!  (Those worship songs were right on.)  I've told you all that God has me up on the mountain for a while.  And it sucks.  But ROCKS!  I have an excuse for saying "no" now.  I can say no.  BECAUSE God said to.  No more working for the time being.  No more delaying and putting off what God has been trying to teach me.  It's NOW.  My time is now.  And I am SUPPOSED to be completely selfish with what God is currently giving me.  Yes, later on God will want and demand that I give out what He's given me.  Though, for now, He's given it to me FOR me.  I'm not used to that.  I'm so different from when I came home.  Just six months ago, and I've completely changed.  Hard to believe I needed to change that much.  Guess I did!  I must have been a real JERK!:)  Anyway.  I'm healing.  And I have less to say.  I'm not supposed to.  So, WHEN ARE THE REST OF YOU GOING TO START SAYING A
