Hey crazy ninos!   I've decided to start one of these bloggy things. God has been teaching me suh much lately...tis a shame not to write it down somewhere. So alas, I turn to the wonderful world of internet. So hopefully I can keep up and remember to write the things in here. I guess we will see how it goes, eh? (that was for all of you Canadians out there....)  Peace.
Weekend Stuffeseses   My modem died so o I haven't been able to type anything on here over the weekend. Darn storms. Well, this weekend was pretty cool. I went to the Riverbats game with a group from Southeast Christian Church. It was the second game I've ever even been to ever. The other one was the Anaheim Angels...well unless you count little league, then I've been to three games total. Anywho, the game got kinda interesting in the last inning and then we lost.   I walked around the stadium alot. It was kinda cool seeing all of the different people. I prayed for alot of them as I walked past. God's really placed that on my heart lately....praying for random people....cuz with God it's never random. All of the people that I have any kind of interaction with whatsoever whether it's as a really good friend or the cashier who always checks me out at the store or the waitress at the restaurant or a person I pass on the street and never say a word to, God has placed them all in my life and in my path for a reason. That's so crazy cool to think about!!! It makes you realize how interactive God is in our lives, whether we realize it or not. It definitely makes me think more about my responsibility as a Christian to pray for these people and, if so led, to start a conversation and possibly some kind of relationship with them. I pray that God would place these people in my path and give me wisdom and courage to take advantage of the opportunities He's given me.  Sunday, I went to church. Woohoo. Kyle Idleman talked about servanthood and how we are called to serve not to be served. And our servanthood is not limited to people who are "servable" (aka: nice, appreciative, respectable, yadda da yadda). We are also called to serve those who annoy us, are rude and unappreciative. And even if we know that they are going to hurt us in the future, it doesn't matter. This is such a big thing for me. I've been praying that God would truly help me to understand forgiveness as He sees it. I kinda hold to a kind of "forgiveness" that says "ok, i will try hard to get along with you despite the fact you've hurt me or ticked me off." It's such bullcrap on my part. I've got to come to the point of realization that I will be hurt and I will be stepped on and even in those times I've got to step out and serve those p
