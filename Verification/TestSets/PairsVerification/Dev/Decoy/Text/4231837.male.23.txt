So after Fridays heavy drinking I decided it would be in my interest to get a culture boost and to see my parents.  We were supposed to be going to  urlLink Bodiam Castle  to see a war re-enactment but as I had a hangover I got up a little late and then got stuck in a traffic jam on the M4.  By the time I got to my parents it was too late to get to Bodiam so we settled on going to  urlLink Polesden Lacey  which is an Edwardian House in Sussex. The things I found most interesting was the early photographs of the family that lived there and some of the info on WWI (which ties in with the Bird Song Book I am reading)  My parents kindly paid for me to become a member of the National Trust which made the people at the entrance gate slightly bemused as to why a scruffy dreadlocked 20 something would hold a membership card.  After looking round for a bit and some ice creams we decided to head for a nearby landmark. Rykas Burger Bar - which is the favourite joint for hundreds of bikers from the surrounding areas.

Loud music makes me drive really quickly, so maybe this is  urlLink not such a great idea .  On Friday night I went into town for a couple of beers with James. We started off in the Purple Turtle which was really packed because the rain was stopping people going into the beer garden.  I was at the bar when I smelt something so familiar that it reminded me of someone or something which had happened to me. I looked around and suddenly saw a girl I once had a one night stand with. I think she saw me but she was with another bloke so I didn't acknowledge her and she didn't acknowledge me. I must have recognised her perfume  After a while talking to a few mates we saw there, we left for The Pavlov's Dog which had more room.  In Pavlov's I spotted a workmate of mine and stayed with her and her boyfriend until closing.  On the way out I stupidly had the idea to go to the  urlLink After Dark Club  which everyone drunkenly agreed to.  I haven't been to The After Dark since me and my mates put on a night called  urlLink Technosense  on there. It w
