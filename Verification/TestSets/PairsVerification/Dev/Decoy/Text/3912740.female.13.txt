room her eyes began to burn and beg for tears to fall but she would not let them.  As the man asked her to come she took in a breath and walked slowly to the desk not breathing at all.  She moved her head so she saw Carol happily standing there almost jumping with joy as she watched.  The man told her to slowly spin around and she did.  She felt her head get light and she watched at the world spin slowly around her.  Then she stopped and the man’s stick pointed in the direction of the train.  She let her breath go as she walked over to the train and stopped to watch Carol.   Her heart never stopped racing knowing that Carol has a 50/50 chance of being killed or living.  Darlene began to cry as she watched. “How old are you there?”  A man asked her. “I’m 5 Sir.” She said proudly and sweetly.
