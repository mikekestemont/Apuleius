you would expect from any crazy individual handing out racist, threatening material on at a St. Patricks Day parade in NYC, you could only read a portion of the paper.  The handwriting was so bad that at least half of it was unreadable.    Besides the parade, which was only a small fraction of our NYC vacation, we did all of the touristy things - the Met, the Empire State Building (which was very unimpressive - Robert hadn't ever been to the top, so we went, but we could go outside because of the weather, and visability was only a mile because of the snow), Central Park (it was beautiful because of all of the snow, but I've seen plenty of snow on trees...here in Ky, so I would have preferred no snow, and warmer tempts.  However, I'm the idiot who went to NY in March), the Frick House (not as impressive as I was hoping, but I may have just not been in the mood)....We saw some great shows.  Match (Ray Liotta play - very good), The Boy From Oz (Hugh Jackman musical - good, but kinda wish that we had seen something else), and Blue Man Group (FANTASTIC).  I feel a little guilty saying that the Blue Man Group was my favorite show, when the other two are far more artistic (or maybe that's a bad judgement on my part), but they were so entertaining!!    Overall, we had a great time.  By the end of the trip, after the cold weather, and our frustrations with not being familiar with the subway...we were both very anxious to get home.  In fact, we both said that we didn't care if we ever went back to NYC.  While I don't see myself going back anytime soon (there are too many other places in this country that I still haven't seen), I do want to go back at some point.  We bitched alot while we were there, but everytime I think back on it, I remember all of the good things.  We really did have a good time.    We also went to Florida in March.  In fact, we went there and saw his family, and then flew to NYC.  During the July 4th weekend we're going to the Smokies.  It's our gift to my parents for their birthdays (which fall like 3 days apart).  We're renting a cabin, and my parents, my brother and sister, their dog Buddy, and Robert and I will all be staying in it.  It's a large cabin. I'm excited about it.  Hopefully it will be very relaxing.  In September, Robert has a convention in Baltimore.  I'm going to go with him, and after the convention, we're going to go to Washington DC and spend a few days going to all of the monuments...I'm really looking forward to that.    Robert's making one last phone call (he spends so much time on the phone that I don't know how he gets any work done), and then he's giving me the rest of the night (we'll see...).  So, I'm off for n
