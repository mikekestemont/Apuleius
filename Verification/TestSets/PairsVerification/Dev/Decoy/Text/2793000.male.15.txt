Oh, hello. Did something happen? Bet on it, bucko. Yeah, that's right, I called you bucko. And you better believe it... and... er... live with it! Yeah....  Well, if you've stumbled in here, you're obviously looking for something.  Keep at that, why don't you.  However, if you came for the updater-whenever-he-feels-like-it adventures of darkshadows86's Unbeiliv-a-blog, then look no freakin' further.

Whoever claimed the Spring break had any sort of 'brak' in it was a lying dumbo.  Today, I have had the worst possible day. Stress,  urlLink Achaea , and a One Winged Angel (referring to the song from FF VII, tyvm.)  Current mood: distraught Music: The Final Fantasy battle theme. Again.
