hey! ive never had a blog before...but sarah (SC!) has inspired me to start one! so nothings really happened so far today. i got up at 9 to watch DAWSON'S CREEK (only the best show EVER) and when that was over at 11, i got myself a bowl of honey-nut cheerios! seriously, those are a classic. then i watched saved by the bell and started looking at my list for everything i needed for CAMP PIKE (9 days)! im going on Wilderness this year (with SJizzle and katy!!) and daaaaaaaang it requires alot of crap! they say we're supposed to fit everything into one little backpack thing...ha yeah RIGHT! the list of stuff we need fills up the ENTIRE page! Sarah Jane and i are gonna have one heck of a time trying to trudge up those mountains with BIODEGRADABLE SHAMPOO and COOKING UTENSILS in our backpacks! hahaha, SJ, this is gonna be a sight to see! but yeah SJ is my tentmate! woot woot! and im realllllly excited because SJ is a blast...if you know her, you know what i mean! but anywaaaays,  im about to go to open gym with sue (last time we kicked some sophmores-to-be @$$). after that i think ill go running, because, as davis says, i need to work on my stamina/conditioning. and then im off to my g-ma's house for the night! in the morning im helping her with this food bank program...so thats cool because im helping people AND its gonna look stellar on my college applications! and i know people get pissed at me for even talking about college now, and for actually caring about my future...but theyre just gonna have to deal with it. i most definitely want to go to TCU (yeah christina!), but we'll see. so i guess ive written alot...probly too much...so yeah, adios!
hey guys! so yesterday i got back from san antonio. it was pretty fun actually. we went to seaworld and on the riverwalk and stuff. i ate at hard rock cafe, which id never done before, so that was cool. i did LOTS of shopping, which i needed because i have absolutely no clothes. and we ate ALOT, and swam at the hotel and stuff. so yeah, all in all, it was fun. we got back in town at like 1 yesterday and then i just came home and watched movies til like 830. then i went to mel's house with catherine, mary, and kelsey. we made cookies (and mel and mary made a dance) for adam. at like 11 we finally finished making the cookies and decorating the box they were to be delivered in, and brought them over to the boys' poker game. i dont think they liked a bunch of girls interrupting their "MANLY game", but oh well. adam seemed to enjoy mel and marys dance and the cookies, so that was good. then we headed out and went to sonic for some malts (thanks catherine!). and then i just went home. and todaaaaaaay my dad woke me up at 12 a
