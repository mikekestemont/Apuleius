Mr. Morganâ€™s common-law wife, was held without bail for action by the grand jury.
Spent a good portion of the day plowing through Hunter S. Thompson's "Hell's Angels." Some wild shit. Just finished reading about some Angels hanging out Ken Kesey's crib. Everybody eating acid and shit. Hunter and Ginsburg getting pulled over as they left Kesey's place. But that's just a small piece of the book. Some crazy fucking tales at the Bass Lake run and whatnot. Anyhow, the Angels have intrigued me since watching "Gimme Shelter" many years ago. I've seen the flick at least 15 times since then.   I'd started reading a few months back. I stopped reading it about half way through for some bizarre reason. Since I was reading Hunter's biography I figured I'd go back and finish "Hells Angels." And ya know, I still haven't fucking read "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." I've tried to watch the flick and can never get through it. I remember digging "Rum Diary" a few years back on a solo trip to Europe. Enough about Hunter...   I think I got pink eye. It feels like I have a grain of sand under my upper eyelid since Friday. It hurts to blink and my eye keeps tearing up. From what I gather, these things usually clear up in a few days, or at least I hope so. It ain't no big thing. Things could be worse, like constipation, which really fucks me up. But I haven't had to deal with that thanks to some stuff my cousin turned me on to... It really rocks the bowels.. Good clean dumps...
It's been a while since I mentioned the Holiday... Hell, a year or so that's all I would write about. Hell, I thought about writing a book about my experiences there. Anyway, somehow I started to this guy about the Cameron Diaz video that's been floating around the net. Yeah, I know it's really fucking pathetic to admit to seeing the thing. It's even more pathetic to talk about it. But he was saying how he liked Cameron and all, and I was surprised he didn't hear about the thing. For those of you who haven't seen it, you're not missing anything. It's bullshit, man. Horrible quality and all that... Jesus, it's even more pathetic to be even writing about it...  And so after a few rounds, I stepped out into the night, and while walking north on 1st Ave. I got the urge to write. So I stopped in a deli on 12th and picked one of the black composition books. I started scribbling and walking. Lets just say it had to do with an ex-girlfriend. I'm not going to get into details, because I plan to revisit what I wrote this weekend and really expound on it.  But ya know, it really felt good to scribble in that fucking notebook. Buzzed and writing ferociously. "Dirge" by Death in Vegas on the headphones. And then looking at girls feet on the subway platform in between word bursts. It was beautiful, m
