Context is everything! A saucy joke at a party is great fun, evoking laughter, but when repeated at a funeral, will only evoke furrowed brows and thoughts of insensitivity.  Sensitivity is required! A hearty "good morning" to a cheerful person may elicit one in return, while a depressed person will probably either ignore you and your greeting.  The point I want to make is that unless you understand the context of a particular situation and are sensitive to the feelings and circumstances that those people are in, a helpful comment can be viewed negatively, a by-the-way remark can be blown into an important statement, etc.. Maturity, balance and giving people the benefit of the doubt until they can be given time to explain are always required. Ultimately, all things will be tested by God who alone can render a perfect judgment because He knows all things and He knows the hearts and motives of all involved in any particular issue. But that will only be on the Day of Judgment which is yet future.   How are we to proceed in our days? The answer for us now is to test all things by God’s plumbline, the Word of God, for the Scriptures are very clear with respect to what is truth (pure, unadulterated truth) and what is error (truth that is mixed with human philosophy, traditions, wisdom from below).  Jacob Prasch has made many statements about Alpha and the Purpose Driven Life which need to be explained in the light of what God’s Word says about it. He lives in the UK, a nation that has already seen the effects of more than 10 years of Alpha and he speaks with first-hand knowledge of the things that have happened there.  How then are we, in Singapore, to view his statements?  Let me begin by setting the context for us.   When the gospel first came to us in Singapore in the 1800s, it was already a "liberal" gospel, in the sense that when the "gospel" was presented, usually there was very little mention made of the need to carry your cross to follow Jesus, the need to die to self, the need to obey the Lord Jesus Christ plus the very real possibility of hostility and persecution by family members. Instead, what was held out was usually the promise of eternal life, healing, peace, mercy, grace... (which are all true and are all wonderful).   However the problem arises when these things are held out as "enticements" to "accept Jesus". Who could resist such a good offer? If I can have Jesus and heaven still continue to live any which way I want, why not? It’s always good to have an egg in every religious basket, another insurance ticket to a good life after death. Why not "try" Jesus? as if He was like a product to be sold! Remember the "I Found It" campaign several years ago.  I myself came to "faith" under such a gospel and it was only about 10 years later that I was brought to a realization t
