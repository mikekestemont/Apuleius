not emotionally exhausted and there is zero interest in trying the dolly again. Our solution, ditch the dolly and drive the 8 hours separately. Getting a good rest beforehand wasn't an option as she was officially out of her apartment, and we were just ready to be gone.  So we make the drive, my only partners being a slew of late night DJs and a quart of some generic Welch's Berry juice which I will gladly be the spokesman for after that trip. We arrive in Philly and are met by a slight FLASH FLOOD. Finding her new apartment wasn't too difficult thanks to the grid system, but getting the mattress out to sleep--which is all we wanted to do at this point--was pretty impossible until the rain let up.  So we lay in her newly painted apartment, on her newly stripped, sanded, and revarnished floors, in some semblance of rest. I may have dozed off for 15 minutes but I was fairly congested from all the fumes and couldn't sleep. Plus I had been soaked in the short sprints from U-Haul to apartment.  The rain finally lets up, a friend that was coming up from DC to help was delayed due to the flooding so we just decided to start unpacking. Help did come, but I believe I have done more than enough set up to accurately diagnose my current physical condition.  Ulcer, sunburn, headache, sore throat, heavy lifting, fatigue, drenching, not too mention one helluva sprint to catch my connecting flight on the way back... I hate complainers, but man I felt pathetic.  So as far as endings go, my friend is now somewhat-successfully living in Philadelphia and I am back in Atlanta, also somewhat-successfully living. I learned that I hate U-Haul, I love Vermont food, and I can never relocate again.
I practice safe surfing.  However, that doesn't prevent the slew of tenacious college girls (and their bevy of adventurous roommates) from attempting to interest me in their web cam from time to time. Just trying to pay tuition no doubt... bless their over-showered hearts.  Well, pop ups apparently are the gateway drug for computers. Or maybe like gray hairs because the more I killed, the more I had. I tried fiddling with security settings in Internet Explorer and a few Ad-Alert and Spyware solutions, but it was too late. My computer had just been around the block too many times.  Also my Norton Anti-Virus software was Win98 and I now run XP. There were some compatibility issues and it wasn't able to catch everything.  So I finally decided to wipe my hard drives clean and start anew; the computer version of born again virginity. Hence the bit of blog lag.  I'd write more, but I'm currently caught in the graceful dance between coughing up one's lung and dry heaving. If computer viruses were communicable I'd be blaming my PC, but then again if I had what it did; it would be more like a burning sensation in embarrassing areas and would require some type of ointment to t
