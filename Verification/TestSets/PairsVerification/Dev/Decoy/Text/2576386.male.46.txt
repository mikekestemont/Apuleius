care then. He stated that the  public schools have seen to the quiet murder of the English language in the Philippines.  Maybe this is inaccurate. I wonder if anyone has done a study on the effects of the change of the medium of instruction in private schools. What I know is that I've read some years back that Law schools  have been complaining about the decline in the quality of their students in speaking and writing the english language, a language that is a vital tool in the practice of the professsion.  Cruz started his article with  when english was the medium of instruction in our schools, practically every Filipino, including those in the barrios, understood and spoke the language  Although he did not deny that ...
