For those of you that don't know, there are many many other operating systems than Windows. There are of course Apple's Macs, but there is a whole nother world out there such as Unix,  urlLink Linux , FreeBSD and others. I'm getting into  urlLink Linux , because unlike Windows and Macs,  urlLink Linux  is completely free. In fact, I'm going to go buy a new computer on Saturday and I am going to make it a dual boot between Windows XP and  urlLink Suse Linux . If I get to know Linux I'm going to make it my permanent operating system. What turned me onto Linux was a version called  urlLink Knoppix .  urlLink Knoppix  is a version that you download, burn and restart your computer.  urlLink Knoppix  runs right off of the cd and dosen't install anything to your computer. It comes jam packed with tons of software. Linux is also more secure than Windows too, isn't that pretty sad? That a completely free operating system is more secure than a operating system that you pay $200 for! The only drawback to Linux is that a lot of popular software such as Microsoft Office dosen't run in Linux. But I have noticed that since the big security hole (Windows XP) came out, more and more software is being developed for Linux such as Unreal Tournament 2004.
Do you always need to be on your computer even while you are at work, school, anywhere but home? You have probably seen advertisements for GoToMyPc and such programs well  urlLink RemotelyAnywhere  is my favorite program for remote access.  urlLink RemotelyAnywhere  works right over your internet browser. It is also much more than a remote control program. You can see what processes are running and stop and end them. If your computer locks up you can reboot it no matter how busy it is. It has a built in telnet server and also an interactive command prompt without being in Windows, has a file transfer utility to give and receive files. You don't even have to remember another password because it uses your Windows user name and password. There are far too many features to talk about. I like that program for the internet but inside a network I like to use Remote Desktop Connection built into Windows XP Pro. To enable it go to control panel, system, remote and check the box that says Allow users to connect remotely to this computer. From there, to connect to it go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, Communication and Remote Desktop Connection and just type in the computer name and hit connect.
Almost every client I have had has asked, is AVG better than Norton? I used to say that just get completely rid of Norton and install AVG. For you people that don't know, AVG is a free Anti-Virus system. I use it for both my personal use and we use it up at school. Up until recently I got rid of Norton on computers I fix and put AVG on but I was wrong. Factory p
