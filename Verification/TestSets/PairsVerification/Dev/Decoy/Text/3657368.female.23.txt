should be me, NOT her.  Why does Kelly get to be pregnant and I dont?  Then later that night Mark came over and asked me if I hated him.  Then he asked if I didn't like him anymore. I asked him why he thought that and he hugged me and said that I used to hug him and talk to him, and know I won't even look at him.  I told Mark that it was to hard for me talk to him.  Then I started crying.   I sat there for a minute then ran down the drive way.  As I passed Matt he ran after me and asked what was wrong.  I told him that I was a horrible person.  I told him what happened and he asked if I wanted to leave.  I told him to finish his cornhole game then we could go. For the next half hour I walked the street alone.  Durning that time I wondered if I should go get Mark and explain things but I couldn't face the crowd.   I don't wish anything bad on Kelly or the baby, but I still don't think she should be pregnant.  I think a part of my problem is I feel like they stabbed me in the back.  Fist by getting pregnant.  Then by not telling us until she absolutely had too.  I think if she wouldn't have come to the wedding and the party we still wouldn't know.  And finally, because she told the whole world and left us out.  So much for being a friend.  I know she was trying to not hurt us but that's what she did.  I think those are the main reasons I only have a problem with her pregnancy and not anyone elses.  Hopefull one day I will be able to be happy for her, but I don't think that will happen until I get pregnant.  I've decided that I'm going to take Matt's advice and not worry about it.  When I get pregnant and stay pregnant then that's when I'll talk to Kelly.  Hopefully, Our friendship won't be beyond repair at that point. _______________________________________________  Yesterday was our Anniversary, and I spent it with my SIL.  Matt had to work until 9:00 so we went and saw a movie.  We saw Tom Cruises new move and I have mixed feelings on it.  Not get me wrong it was good but the ending sucked!  I think they could have done a little something more and it would have been a great movie.  Oh Yeah I was talking about our anniversary.  We are going to be celebrating Saturday.  Matt gets off at 5:30 so we are going to dinner that night, then maybe to a movie or something.  I'm thinking we are going to go to Kenwood and have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  Everyone says how good it is so I think we'll try it.  We haven't made any real plans, but that's normal.  I guess I really don't have much to say about our anniversary since we haven't really celebrated i
