Well, I just can't resist taking some potshots at some businesses and their horrifically laughable and simply mind-numbing marketing and branding activities. Alright, I'm sure a lot of us would have heard about marketing techniques aimed at the GEN X and how conventional advertising techniques and channels often don't work that well as they have grown immune to such forms of blatant advertising. Coupled with hearing how word-of-mouth advertising is making rounds, many companies turn to such a tecnique in hopes of getting the product out to the consumers. You've often heard of how they say, "Give the popular kids your product first and make them be seen wearing it...hopefully the trend will take off" Well, that's indeed a good way to start, but if done horribly. It could very much mean you have booked a spot at the crematorium for your company. Well, if there's a worst case example, I think this has to be it.  Alright, here's the story I heard: There was this particular Contact Lenses Company (whom I'm not naming, though I would really love to), who decided to start a campaign within the polytechnic promoting their new daily color lenses..hmmm..alright sounds good..so there was this bloke who was sent to look out for good looking guys and girls to shortlist as "candidates", well, it goes downhill from here. Their proposition was that these people would be sponsored by the company and will be given free lenses to wear, and in exchange for that, they are supposed to go around telling other people about their lenses..So what's wrong? Plenty. First, they treat these candidates as stupid beggars whom they think are desperate enough for free lenses to go around promoting them to other students. Two, blatantly choosing these people and letting everyone know about the deal isn't exactly the wisest thing to do. Three, they are not giving these things to this people and letting them discover the merits of the product and marketing it to others themselves through word-of-mouth, rather, it was a bizarrre demand that once they are supplied with the contact lenses, they are supposed to promote them. What do they think they are doing?! Buying puppets? I suppose when the campaign fails, they will go back complaining how those marketers writing stuff about word of mouth and viral marketing are really just plain crap. Pity the fools.
For international viewers, I am expressing my views as of the climate here in Singapore.    Walk into any McDonald's outlet and a few things instantly hits you. VIBRANT, COOL, CLEAN. Walk into any KFC outlet, you don't really get that same sensation. Just look at the staff uniforms. Black polo shirts with I'm Lovin It emblazoned on it. KFC's? Pale yellow shirts with blue pants and an embroidery of Colonel Sanders' face on the pocket. Amazingly, both pay part-time workers, an hourly rate of $3.50 an hour. But I believe, young people would rather don a McDonald's black polo tee than a dull-looking yellow shirt. What's that got to do with branding? Lots in fact. Knowingly o
