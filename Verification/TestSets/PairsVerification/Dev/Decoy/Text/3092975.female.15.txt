right next to me and they get quiet all of a sudden. I dont think she realizes it cause she is the one talking. But I dont want her to say something and then they go say she was talking shit. Cause then she gets all sad and shit.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Anyway. Went back to the block chilled there and then took her home then i went home to  find no one there. then later on my family came with pizza I ate stood online and went to sleep.   Yup like I said...... it was normal.
well life sucks .. but what else is new. Jobless with no life. All i do is attend school for 4 hrs a day and come home and do nothing, go to my friends block and chill there till my gf gets home, take her home then go home to do some more nothing. Now thats a great ass life wouldnt you think?-_-. yea its great..........Well lets see... My gf got paid a few days ago and went through a massive breakdown cause she couldnt get it out of the bank... cuase she didnt realize that she didnt change the password rather than her account password so she kept putting the incorrect code. but eventually  i got that straightened out. Yay me!!!....I decide to go with her to the movies dreading every step i take knowing im not the one paying for it. Its like someone taking a small vein that runs into my heart and just pulling on it really hard everytime she pays for something. Then we went to eat. That i dont care about, I buy food every once in awhile.  So yea.

Instead everything i glanced at she wanted to buy. Why cant she understand how low and pathetic that makes me feel. I was always brought to depend on no one and never take unless its absolutely necessary. And to top it off its been very hot and what no one seems to understand is that my real only weakness is heat. I cant stand it. It hurts. I can walk for hours with agony and pain in my feet back shoulders anywhere if its cold. If its hot i wont make it too far barely 15 minutes.  But i tried to make her happy by doing that... although I dont think I succeeded.  The heat is the only thing that changes me entirely. And its hard not being able to control it. I try so hard not to yell or get mean to her. I dont know what it is either but lately I have been getting aggrevated with every little thing in everybody.  Whats wrong with me?Why am i so unhappy?I think i need h
