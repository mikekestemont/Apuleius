The following are three stories from south of Chicagoland regarding the  urlLink Socialist Equality Party 's Tom Mackaman's successful struggle to get on the ballot, and a slate of  urlLink Illinois Green Party  candidates' unsuccessful battle to do the same. The Illinois Democrats are pulling the same dirty tricks downstate that they're pulling against Nader in Chicago.     urlLink  Champaign, Illinois electoral board bars Green Party candidates World Socialist Web Site [USA]    ... By Jerry White, 10 July 2004  The Champaign County, Illinois electoral board voted July 6 to exclude the entire slate of Green Party candidates running for county-wide positions in the area, which is home to the 38,000-student campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The undemocratic decision was the culmination of a sustained effort, particularly by state and local Democratic Party officials, to block the Green Party from gaining ballot access. This included efforts to disrupt petitioners, intimidate students who decided to run as Green Party candidates and use pseudo-legal measures to raise the number of signatures required to attain ballot status and challenge the signatures that were collected.  The Illinois Democrats are using similarly unscrupulous methods in an effort to bar from the ballot Tom Mackaman, the Socialist Equality Party’s state legislative candidate in the 103rd District. Geraldine Parr, the current treasurer and former chairperson of the Champaign County Democratic Party, has filed a series of patently false objections to signatures collected by SEP supporters in order to remove Mackaman from the ballot and prevent any challenge to the Democrat incumbent State Representative Naomi Jakobsson.      urlLink  Illinois county clerk’s findings vindicate SEP petitions World Socialist Web Site [USA]    ... The Champaign County Clerk on Friday issued a preliminary judgment on the objections filed by the Democratic Party against the petitions of Socialist Equality Party Illinois state legislative candidate Tom Mackaman ...  After comparing the signatures with voter registration rolls, County Clerk Mark Shelden threw out 478 of the Democrats’ objections and upheld only 174—a ratio of nearly three-to-one in favor of the SEP. Combined with the original 982 signatures not objected to, and the 71 objections conceded by the Democrats during the preliminary examination by his staff last week, Shelden’s recommendation would give Mackaman 1,547 signatures—far more than the 1,325 required to place him on the ballot in the November election.  In one case the Democrats objected to 17 out of 20 signatures on a single petition sheet. After the county clerk compared the information on the petition to the signers’ voter registration cards he ruled that 16 of the 17 were in fact valid registered voters.  Shelden’s findings show that the Democrats employed “shotgun” methods, in which hundreds of signatures were arbitrarily selected to challenge without ever investigating the registration rolls. This confirms that the entire objection process has been an exercise in political deception and intimidation aimed at keeping Mackaman and the SEP off the ballot and excluding any opposition to the Democrats’ pro-war and pro-big-business policies.      urlLink  DEMS withdraw petition protest Urbana/Champaign News-Gazette - Champaign/Urbana,IL,USA    ... you go through an experience like this y
