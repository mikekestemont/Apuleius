i'm saying this but I think i'm starting to understand what Blink 182 was talking about in that song. You know the one admit it. Had an epiphany whilst filling a car at pump 6... Being depressed about things as trivial as high school crushes or crap like that is just a waste of energy. Shit happens ya gotta just roll with the punches and...throw them 'bows and all that good time jazz. I guess what I'm saying is I've decided not to get hung up on some girl that I barely even know. Chalk one up for those damn glands right? Oh well. Listening to Bob Marley and really wanting to get drunk. Never gonna happen judging by the current state of my social life. I always get the same thing "Oh yeah we totally should do something I call ya *insert day/time/date in general here)" And guess what they never do. Whatever. Fuck it. I'll save my liver for pickling some other night. I still feel like a dork and/or a 13 year old girl when I post on here. "Dear Diary tee hee" puhleeze. Still it feels good to get some things off my chest. I'm still working up the courage to talk about my dad. There's alot to sift through and I don't know if I'll like what I see when I get through. Listening to love songs when your single and desperate is really depressing I gotta tell ya. Well I've got nothing else to say tonight so i think I'll go play some video games...and then I wonder why I don't have a girlfriend...
Yeah so first post on this thingy WHOOO!! I've been making fun of people who used this for the last bit of while and now i find myself...using it..??? Anyhoo.... yeah this summer has sucked my ass so far. Working at the co-op gas bar is the lamest job ever. Bad pay, bad shifts, lame managers the usual. In sticking with the emo mystique I guess I should be obliged to spill my feelings in some form of lame poem or something so how about this....  Raindrops keep falling on my head Yeah I already screwed this Haiku up (is that how ya spell it??)  I guess I can express how I feel using the immortal words of one 50 (fitty) cent. And I quote "In this white man's worl I'm similar to the squirrel. Looking for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut."  I told the girl of my dreams how I felt about her a few months ago but got shut down like...a guy getting shut down. I'm just gonna say to her...You say no one wants to be with you but I did and you said no. Think about that next time you mention all that jazz... I just realized how egotistical sounds. Can't think of a better way to word it. sorry.  My parents....I'll save for another time. That subject deserves a post all to itself.  Anyhoo I'm off to pump some vehicular orifice. A
