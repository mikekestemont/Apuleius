deliciously humid out.  breezey. puffy clouds.  sun.  full of smiley random exchanges with strangers.  time to run back outside.
and somehow, until today, i missed lyndon larouche.  i can't imagine how.  kids for his campaign were desperately trying to get attention at school this afternoon.  "children of satan III: the sexual congress for cultural fascism" caught my eye.  scarily enough, i was drawn to some of what  i read.  http://larouchein2004.net/   satan is here.  didn't ya know?   kerry?  maybe edwards will give him more of an edge?
oh yeah, and moore sucks.  http://politics.slate.msn.com/id/2102723/
it's wednesday night.  i'm home.  rare.  11:32 pm.  i'm determined not to go anywhere., but it's still early.    things that happened over the last week: .....................  actually no, let's not do that.    hung out with the usual suspects, and a few not so ususal.  had a lazy 4th, culminating in geting drunk while making vegan delights and annoying courtney and will with my endless ramblings about the 80s and lisa and wendy while watching purple rain.  courtney had never seen it, nor will she ever watch it again.  locked eyes with cole.  got over starr awkwardness. made plans with and flaked(sorta) on tiffany.  Oh! i need to return shawn's book, i keep running into him, and he keeps asking to take me to lunch or dinner, which has really been putting me off.  he had some hot kiwi chick with him last night, i was impressed and happy for him.  played some gorgeous pool.  didn't go to the gym nearly enough.  i'm thinking of starting some sort of "plan" to get buff-ish, or toned.  i'm becoming obsessed with the thought.  speaking of, i think my sex fixation phase has ended.  i'm not sure what i think about this.  i'm not sure if i was genuinely concerned about it either.  actually, i wasn't at all.....but what does it mean to be perpetually horny?  a healthy lust for life.  note to self: think about that.  meat in all forms has made me wretch this week.  i'm slipping back into a rut.    justine.  how do i break this mold i convinced myself is me?  cut down on pot.  switch from beer to liquor.  maybe smoke more pot.  caffeine to remain the same.  green tea is good.  go to more shows.  stop mental masturbation when the feeling hits you.  get your ass up early for the gym.  haille barry's cat woman costume sucks, btw.    read.  hang with the dog.
i just poured a glass of some kind of ancient brandy from under the bar.  i had to add ice of course.  and some water.  i stayed in tonite.  for no real reason other than i feel i'm never home at night, and it must mean i'm running away.  this was the case even when i didn't live at my parents' home.  i'm way too excited about a joint i'm about to roll.....it has been a night of reading, and daydreaming.....i really wanna figure out how to splash my head onto paper.   		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?
