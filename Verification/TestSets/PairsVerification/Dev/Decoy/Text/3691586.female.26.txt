i'm totally zapppeedd! got back from singapore early this morning at about 3am then had a short nap before dragging my shell to work. well.. not entirely an empty shell, my brain actually function for today! :oP i must be getting used to my past whole week of insomnia already...  someone told me that singapore sales is the same as malaysia sales. boy oh boy, were they wrong!! its a shopping haven! especially if i were earning singapore dollars... loved the jewellery choices and designs there but prefer the shoes selection here back in KL.   as for sight seeing... i went to the 71st floor of swiss hotel to get a bird's eye view of part of singapore and saw esplanade (a singaporean friend called it the durian :oP). i wanted to go for night safari but it was raining so.. sigh.. couldn't get to see the eyes in the darkness.  oh yeah, i had this really delicious and yummy dumplings at 'din tai fung' restaurant at paragorn mall (orchard road)! also, i tried mos burger for the first time n its not too bad. they had this strawberry dessert which was cold and part of the inside was filled with white chocolate and cream or something which i think was pretty different and unique. oh! and there's this place called the bakers inn at paragorn mall as well that serves pretty good italian food and yuuummmmyyy mouth watering dessert!  a bigggg thank you to ah boy for driving us to singapore, wk for being our tour guide and also mgk lee for keeping me company to do aimless shopping :oP  -Smile and the world smiles with u!!-   in reply to esurl's comments on 21 june 2004  thanks for reading my blog! am glad u find it interesting :o) thanks for ur comments and ur view points.. i really appreciate the time u took t
