been going on in the wake of his death. This guy was in NO WAY a good president and it is a shame that he's getting credit for things like ending the Cold War. In all liklihood, he actually EXTENDED it! This guy really hurt America and I think that the negative effects of his presidency will be felt for a long time.   Tyson, what do the Russians think of Reagan? It seems to me that crediting him with the end of the Cold War takes a lot of recognition away from the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union who, through many different means, gradually wore down the Communist regime, proving it couldn't work.
Ronald Reagan: Great president? Or greatest actor of all time? Thoughts?
Friends,       Our beloved band "Creed" has called it quits.  Scott Stapp, what will we do without you?  Creed's innovation and integrity will be difficult to replace in today's world of corporatized and slickly marketed rock.        You were the first to woo our ears with your angst-ridden, soul-bearing vocals (well, besides Kurt Cobain).   You were the first to hypnotize us with your baritone, "grunge-like", yet soothing growl (well, besides Eddie Vedder).   You were the first to "rock" us with your embracement of power-chord passion (excepting Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Rage, etc.)  Scott, You were the first hard-rocker to bravely don the cowboy hat (well, besides Pantera).   You were the first to shamelessly go shirtless in videos and performances, displaying your chiseled physique for all the world to see (well, besides Glenn Danzig, and Jim Morrison before him). You were the first to show us your wrenching connection to the music through fist-clenching and arm-spreading (well, besides Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey). Scott, may your solo effort (with Ja Rule and Nelly record-producer "7 Aurelius") strike us with the depth and high art heard in Nelly's musical interpretations.  Trite imitators? I think not!  Thank You Creed, No really...  http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=638&e=3&u=/nm/20040604/en_nm/music_creed_dc
It's actually been a pretty good year for film so far. Spring was particularly good, with the release of Eternal Sunshine, Kill Bill, Passion and the surprising Hellboy. Eternal Sunshine has emerged as both Charlie Kaufman's and Michel Gondry's best work. I sincerely hope that Kaufman can keep up this level of creativity for at least a few more films.  Summer was pretty weak at first, with a bunch of mediocre offerings finally offset by the documentaries Super Size Me and Fahrenheit 9/11. Then came Spider-Man 2, possibly the best comic book film yet made and on top of that, a truly great showcase for director Sam Raimi. This guy deserves to be in the pantheon. He is both a unique visual stylist and a fantastic director of actors. Anyway, here is the list. I recommend all of the following highly.  1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2. Kill Bill Volume 2 3. Super Size Me 4. Fahrenheit 9/11 5. Napoleon Dynamite 6. Spider-Man 2 7. Touching the Void 8. Hellboy 9. The Passion of the Christ 10. The Five Obstructions  I'll be back later with "The Movies That S
