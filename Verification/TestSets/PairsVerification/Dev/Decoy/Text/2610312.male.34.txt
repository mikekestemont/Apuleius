Got woken up this morning by my mum calling from Menorca, not to see how I am but to ask me to send her some money asap, also had 10 text messages asking the same. Rushed in to town and am now £200 lighter.     &nbsp;   Had a nice email and that cheered me up now end, here are some of the pictures from the mail   &nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Just goes to show there is always something to cheer you up on a bad day.     &nbsp;   My blog is now hosted by my brothers network, so thanks to Steve for setting it all up for me.
I have been keenly reading my brothers blogs for the last week or so and have decided to give it a try as well.&nbsp; I have always found writing very hard being a dyslexic (why is it dyslexic people&nbsp;can spell dyslexic with no problems!) but I have decided to put that behind me and see where this takes me.      &nbsp;   Well it is a little before 5 am and I am having my usual sleepless night thanks to a cat who thinks it is great fun to jump on her mum when she is trying to sleep! grrr     &nbsp;   I came across this on my PC earlier, I forgot&nbsp;I had it but&nbsp;I think its worth a thought or two     &nbsp;        I wonder how many of us would find a recently repaired wall in our own basement,&nbsp; were we to look...........  &nbsp;  Two travelling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family.
