There was an interesting guy at work today.  This may take a little getting-to.  For those who don't know, and i'm assuming this is all of you since I just started posting here, I work at the local library.  I shelve books and I talk to my coworkers and I get paid, and that's just about it.  Today was the start of two things for me; my coworkers and I started working four hour shifts instead of the typical three hour ones we use during the school year, and the summer reading program officially started taking requests.    The four hour thing will be easy to get used to since it comes with more money.  The summer reading program, however, is the source of so many little kids that it boggles my mind how libraries ever came to be considered quiet.  Kids will be screaming and running through the aisles, and when I try to shelve my assigned section there will be two-foot-tall blonde headed kids screaming for the snake books.  I was tired after I got through my shelving assignments today.  I got back to the shelving room where we keep all the materials waiting to be re-ordered and replaced on the shelves, and I had myself a soda.

He has his hair in a buzz cut and is wearing a button down shirt with something about the entertaining industry embroidered near his breast pocket.  Tanya is already in there, standing with the hands on her hips and smiling, listening to this old guy ramble on as his bends over and places a boxy cover on a portable sound board.  He's talking about this old school teacher of his who was apparently rich as all hell.  The entertainer cracks jokes about him in just about every sentence, and actively represents Rodney Dangerfield.  Rod tells me that his old government teacher is the main reason that he doesn't have kids today.  "Would you invite a dog who shits all over the place into  your  house for a day?  The hell you would.  With a kid, you're stuck for life!"  When we get his stuff to the parking lot, he rolls around his child-molester van that he got for the high price of $800 three years ago.  It's his prize possesion, and it's still holding up with duct t
