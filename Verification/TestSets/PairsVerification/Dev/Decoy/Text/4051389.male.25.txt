There's a new movie coming out called  urlLink Cellular .  Basically, a kidnapped police officer gets through to a guy on his cell phone and asks him to help her out.  All I can say is that if the person she called has  urlLink SprintPCS , she might as well just give up now.  Her call will certainly be dropped!
As my friends and my waistline are well aware, my favorite meal is dessert.  So, I consider myself a bit of an expert on all things sugar-related.  Recently a friend of mine mentioned to me that he had seen  urlLink Reese's Pieces  with Peanuts in his Chicago office, and since I enjoy both Reese's Pieces and M&Ms with peanuts, I thought I should try this new product.  Well, two weeks later, the new RP variety made a cameo at my office out in the suburbs.  From the title of this post, you've probably gathered that I did not care for this latest Hershey creation.  Luckily, it's a "limited edition" so it won't be on the shelves forever, but I urge you not to give into the flashy packaging and intriguing idea!
Try  urlLink Lemmings !&nbsp; It's no " urlLink The Incredible Machine ," but Lemmings is a classic puzzle game.&nbsp; If you get addicted, don't call me!

So I signed up for this just to comment on another blog, but why not jump right into sharing my thoughts with people who didn't ask for them anyway?&nbsp; As a character in Annie Hall once said, "I'm shallow and don't have anything interesting to say."&nbsp; Still, perhaps something witty will come to me eventually.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; If it does, I'll be sure to share it on here!   Interesting thing:&nbsp; when I spell-checked this entry, the only error it pointed out was the word "blog."&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I understand that it's not a word, but I would think this particular website would a
