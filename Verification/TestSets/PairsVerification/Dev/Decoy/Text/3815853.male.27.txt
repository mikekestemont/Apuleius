As some of you reading may know, the site  urlLink Gaming Open Market , hereinafter "GOM," was allegedly defrauded for $3000US.  What this site does is trade currency between online communities, worlds, and games.  In this blog, I will mention those terms often, and it's important that I define them as such.  An online community is a group of individuals interacting inside of a predominantly social environment.  An online world is similar, but with less focus on social interaction and more focus on creativity or development.  An online game is something along the lines of a MMORPG, where the focus is on skilling a character by hunting, clanning, or crafting.  Collectively, and generically, I'll refer to them as metaverses, which are defined in many places as  urlLink virtual online representations of reality.   Although I find that GOM provided an exceptionally intriguing service, it was, at least partially, illegal.  Although There, Inc. and Second Life do allow third party transfers of their in-world currency, the vast majority of online metaverses do not allow this.  Lineage 2 (L2), a new release from NCSoft is struggling with this issue in the game's infancy.  Such prohibitive language can be seen in Paragraph 7 of Lineage 2's  urlLink Agreement of Use .  Although one could argue that this does not mean players cannot sell/trade "Adena" (L2's in-game monetary unit), the developers construe it as such and are enforcing it.  In a thread on the official L2 forums,NCSoft's DhevrinNC makes a post (3rd down) that is directly  urlLink on point .    These companies invest hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars of capital into creating these online metaverses.  The environments they create generally consist of their own intellectual property.  This is, of course, changing with the introduction of There and Second Life, but those companies have been remarkably open with their property rights.  Traditional gaming corporations are much less likely to be as giving.  From my lay perspective, it appears as though they see any profit being made by third parties as money being taken out of their pockets.  It is arguable as to whether this belief is based in fact.    Prohibitions, construed from intellectual property law, to prevent those third parties from financial gain are why places like GOM will be unable to function for the foreseeable future.  Even There will not assist with currency exchange issues between third parties.  Second Life's Linden Lab has been much more accommodating, but it seems as though Linden is willing to venture into the forefront of digital property rights experimentation; often to a point even I would find uncomfortable.  This is an unfortunate response, although it is understandable.  The parent corporation does possess a valid intellectual property right in the in-game money and items that one earns or purchases.  Developers such as Sony and EA have always exhibited strong protectionist leanings.    One might argue that because a player earns these items or currencies, the player has a vested property right in them.  However, usage agreements explicitly state that the world exists under the supreme rule of the d
