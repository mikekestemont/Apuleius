Here is me again, doing  my chemistry homework on biopolymers... would help if I knew what a biopolymer was again, but that's beside the point.... school hols end today, technically, because tomorrow's the weekend :( that's not good - I really liked the holidays and I'm so tired already and term hasn't even started yet :(  &nbsp;  My little brother's playing the computer (as always) and he's playing Avernum the shareware copy - rather fun, but addictive and long and I think I have to do some work - I can't wait until&nbsp; the HSC's over then I can do it all over again next year...&nbsp;for most people, I think that the end of the HSC is a period of time where you can forget school - for me, it's like 'ah done that now let's do it all over again' ah well can't wait until next year then me is off to uni!!! YAY!!!!  &nbsp;  is it just me or is the 'create' thingo different - I don't remember being able to change font, font size or font colour before.... maybe i'm just silly and inattentive and all that jazz (aagh! - not again)  &nbsp;  Still love Josh Groban. Still want his other CD. hmmmmmm which reminds me I haven't been on Ebay for a while.... let's go get other CD I think :P&nbsp;  _________________________________  Le mie mani stringono
now I'm figuring out how to use this site - it's a pretty good setup actually, except I don't know what to use for a display pic (I suppose I'll find one someday when I can be bothered but I'll just remain faceless for now I guess)  I really should be studying for the trials which are on in about 3 or 4 weeks or something like that and I have the distinct feeling that I have chemistry homework due first week back - I know that I have music homework due and an english assessment task.... and don't ask me about physics - I wonder if the HSC does this to everyone or am I just insane? hmmmm  I'm still a bit annoyed at the hairdresser who 'wrecked' my hair (i.e. changed it to something I didn't want at the time - I suppose it'll grow on me and I'll get used to it and not mind so much but at the moment.... - I take 'layered' to mean 'having 3 or more 'layers' of hair', as opposed to 'having 2 short bits at the front which look really silly because they're uneven too and look like I'm trying to grow out a fringe or something'... ah well I'll stop complaining about my hair and go do some work now so I'm allowed to go shopping in half an hour (yay!)  ____________________________________ But I'll always remember... you're only an ocean away....
