reasons?  Don't understand, really don't understand... why do i always have to be so lonely? am i destine to be this way? no matter how hard to try, no matter how hard i change, it seems nothing has changed.   People always say sorry, but nothing gonna change, saying sorry and expect nothing had happened, and arent gonna change their mistakes as well.. so what is the point of saying sorry when nothing can be done, when nothing can be changed or nothing is going to changed?  I try so hard to change myself, i really tried... people are greedy and ask for more.. so i give them more and they want more... i always try to satisfy them cos i know i needed a fren, a companion, who will give me abit of concern, who will standby me and lend me their listening ear... no one, no one could do that for me! why? don't understand, really confused.. what have i done to deserve this kinda treatment? what have i done to deserve this kinda loneliness?   Day after day, month after month, years after years... i have been waiting, waiting for a companion... now im getting very tired of waiting already... really tired of waiting... been so lonely for so many years... why do i felt so lonely? why do i have to wait for so long, so long?   Saddness....
I never meant to be like this.. He is whom am i to be.. He is whom i had become.. He is whom suppose to be me... He is the man behind the mirror..  I lived in fear once. Fearing what will happen to me next.. fear of losing my meals, fear of being alone, fear of adults, fear of humans, questions starts to arise... the 'why' word starts appearing in my head...   Time flies, i learn to survive, learn to enjoy pain, learn to enjoy darkness, learn to enjoy the loneliness around me, learn to lie, learn to cheat... just to survive and i did..   As i grew up, i always wanted to change, change to be a better man and i did... tats why i never give up, never give up on people, i wanted give them hope, give them support that they need.. but why do they give up hope on me? 'stubborn' is the word they use on me because i stated my reasons and my points of view. Chance is what i need and i have been chasing after it. i change wat i can and i already did my best but people still don't give me chance when i fail once... they just give up on me... why?  Now, i begin to like the name 'Sin'. I wonder why? maybe it's because I am one. So i will start calling myself Sin and it seems i liked it alot.   I have been living in the darkness too long... now i'm starting to break loose.. what will i become next? why do i fear myself so much? what will happen next? i think only i can e
