was fine.. finally saw my first shrek (the 2nd one) and mean girls. and listened to onflight radio CUZ THEY WOULD NOT LET US LISTEN TO CDS ON THE !0 HOUR FLIGHT. but it eventually ended and I arrived. Was met by the madrichim Hadguy and Lilach and the supervising prof Mark Gelber. I am considered a MAPMES student while the madrichim were really there for the benefit of OSP students. They have all paid for extra trip's and stuff. Yesterday we toured the campus, ate pizza lunch and chilled out. Today I went for a hike with the OSP kids at a Wadi.. Avrut I think. Saw gazelles and waterfall ad had interesting talks. yumy yummy sandwhiches for lunch. After we went to Sde Boker, saw Ben Gurion's grave. IT's cool cuz Hadgui/Hagui (can't remember which) and MArk Gelber have opposing political views on israel's environmental/ social policies so its nice to hear the debate going.       Me  : I"m super jet lagged and my right ear feels like its getting infected. was a bit overwhelmed yesterday but now that I have toilet paper, bought water hummous and pita, emptied the fly covered garbage left by absent roomates, and money.. I feel good. Tommorw I will be adventurous and go walk to find the big superstores that Gelber pointed out on the bus ride home. I also can't wiat for the library to open.. you see, everythign is closed for shabbas so I don't know what is or isn't open. Also I hear that there is Rikudiyah tommorow (israeli dancning) WOO HOO!     Contact :  Shortly I will be recieving an 800 number that makes it free for anyone in Canada to contact me. The only charges are for minutes on my end (damned cellphones). I also found this faux msn thing so I will try to get on msn once in a while. The time difference in 7 hours ahead of Canada and I guess only 2 or three ahead of England..    c'est tout,    love, Steph
Guess what time it is. Yeah, 2.50 AM.  So it's still shabbat, I still can't sleep and my ear still hurts.  But the night is gorgeous.  I"m so happy I decided to leave my room and get out cuz the night is fresh and inviting.  Makes me ache to walk and explore.  But technically I should be sleeping.  Yet,  I"m not the only one in this money computer lab that open 3 pm til 8am.  I say money cuz these compters have cd roms and I think that's a printiing station next to me.  Advil is a life saver.  Let's all cross our fingers that the infection ( which jumped across ears clandestinely) doesn't reach the painful heights of ye who I left behind a week before in Canada. I almost dread to think of how I"ll keep myself busy tommorow.  I have discoveed that there are capoeria classes in the gym across the street on Sunday.  What a good location eh? Dance and cap just across the street.  Ok, let's try this sleep thing a
