Yes, I spent the weekend at the cabin, on a lake. It's great to have a cabin, the problem with cabins is that manytimes they're packed with relatives. I love my relatives, don't get me wrong, but I love to be able to relax somewhere and smoke my joint, rather than going off to hide somewhere. I supposed it shouldn't matter, shouldn't my family love me for who I am. Well, yes, but I guess I just don't want to put them in the position that they have to say "hey, wanna go do that somewhere else?" That would make me want to say "no, I don't want to go do this somewhere else, right here on the beach is just as good a place as back in the woods." ....but that would never fly. So, I guess I'll just have to deal with woodsness.
I read somewhere that time as we think about it, is more or less a property of light (i.e. as you approach the speed of light, the way time itself progresses, changes), then doesn't measuring certain properties of light in units of time seem recursive? That is to say, if light moves at 186,000 miles/second, and you were something that could move at 186,000 miles/second, how long would a second actually be? There's an idea that the speed of light is the fastest speed there is, but is it? At the speed of light, because time becomes so distorted compared to how we think of it, couldn't there be a speed faster than what you're moving at? Because time might be so off kilter, might there not be a way to view things that just isn't possible at velocities much MUCH slower than light? Oh well, blog on!  I told you I might be back!
Well, another day, another thought.  Today was an average day, I guess.  I worked, I played, I'm going to bed (just not now).  I'm going to Boston in like a little more than a month, I'm really excited for that. Here's a middle size Midwestern city boy going to, by my standards, a HUGE east coast city. I don't want to admit that I'm slightly nervous, but I am. A city that size, that far away is pretty intimidating (for me). It'll be an experience I'll forever remember, especially since I'm going to see someone. Her name is Gwen. I met Gwen like 2 years ago now, but I've still been talking to her on the internet pretty often during the interim. Gwen and I hit it off when we met, the thing that bothers me is that, I don't understand why the interaction hasn't decayed. I can't say I know her that well, she was here for like a weekend 2 years ago, and even then, we didn't spend a whole lot of time together. Maybe I should just ignore my apprehension, maybe it won't matter and we'll still have a great time together and when I leave things will go back to being just like they are now, maybe there's m
