Chalk it up as lesson learned.  I get it.  I understand.  Now enough!  My wife and I moved into our house last November (Thanksgiving weekend to be exact).  Too late in the year to effectively start a lawn.  So we waited untill this spring.  Spring is now.  And for the past 4 days Michigan has been HAMMERED with severe storm after severe storm.  I don't remember the last time so much severe weather was present.  And, by the way, I had hydroseed put down 4 and a half days ago (Wednesday afternoon for those having difficulty counting).  Hydroseed is this green mixture of recyled paper, seed, and other materials that is sprayed onto dirt wet, and as it drys forms a sticky bond to the dirt.  This is intended to help the seed stay in place during wind, and *light* rain.  What happens to the seed when the dirt it is stuck to washes away?  The answer: It ends up in my neighbors yard.  The other nifty thing about my new house, is that it sits on a hill to create a walkout basement.  Rain.  Dirt.  Hill.  Not a good combination when trying to start a lawn.  Compound that with HEAVY rain (Forest Gump's voice is echoing in my head here) and you have a situation not suited to breeding a new lawn.  Oh yeah, the rain has been sooooo heavy that the dirt is starting to wash away from UNDER by side walks.  It would take quite a bit to explain the layout here, but the short of it is, next to my front door is a small (maybe 80 sq ft) area of dirt that we will eventually plant stuff in.  Two sides of this area are bordered by the house.  The other two are bordered by the porch and sidewalk.  In that little area I also have a downspout from my gutters.  Yep, sooo much water has flowed out of that gutter that it has tunneled UNDER the sidewalk.  Ahhh...the joys of home ownership.  But as bad as I have it, it cannot compare to people who have been hit with tornadoes, and damaging storms.  Some of those people lost their homes, not just some dirt from under their sidewalk.  My heart goes out to those people who find themselves houseless today.  Articles like  urlLink this  puts my little problem in perspective.  A little bit of dirt and some hard work, and my "problem" is solved.  Some have lost things that can never be regained.  Photos, family heirlooms, and other precious items ruined by mother nature's latest strike.  Sometimes, we need to be reminded that no matter how bad we think we have it, it could be worse.
I must apologize.  I incorrectly stated that the "brilliant guy" was leaving pertinent information showing in the barcode.  I was informed that it's only a library card number.    I made a poor choice in an example.  However, I did find another  urlLink example .  My point was not intended to focus on the specific examples, but rather the incredulous act o
