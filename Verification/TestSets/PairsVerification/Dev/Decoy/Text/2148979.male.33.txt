I had to admit to a couple of my friends this week that I am broke.  It must've been because I spent over $575 on shirts, pants, dress boots, and underwear...and that is just the stuff I remember putting on my plastic THIS month.  Ok, enough is enough.  Time to stop medicating my insecurities by spending so much.  *splashes water on face*  When I get home tonight I'm going to make full use of this Microsoft Money software package I received when I bought my computer.  It's no fun looking at a low balance in my bank account.  I justified it by telling myself, hey, at least it's better than having a low sperm count.  I really couldn't help myself this month.  Once I stepped into Chinook Centre all bets were off.  There is something about the environment of that shopping mall that screams "be one of us...be beautiful...have all of these beautiful women walking the halls for yourself...be the star."  I swear to God that the mall is alive.  The entrance that I use is beside a hair salon that is full of gorgeous and well-dressed women.  I think that's one of the places where the mall spawns these women from her womb to purposefully torment me.  It was pretty bad 2 weeks ago when I stepped through the glass doors of Mexx to be greeted by this wonderful creature wearing a slim-fitting black skirt and thigh-high CFM boots.  Her blue eyes fell upon me and she didn't flinch.  I could just feel that gaze slipping the credit card out of my wallet.  Oh yeah, she knew exactly what she was doing.  We both made our way to the (clothes rack) bar and had a look at what was on the menu.  She suggested things that were quite unpalatable to me, so I had to guide her to the right places and teach her what I liked.  We both courted each other retail-style, sliding the clothes seductively over the thin changeroom door back and forth, back and forth, gingerly cradling and fondling the garments while having her talk to me when I was in nothing but my briefs and socks.  3 shirts and 1 pair of pants later, my hair is a little messy and each of us is smoking the proverbial cigarette at the sales counter with her asking if it was good for me too.  And no, I didn't call her the next morning.
Why haven’t I updated lately?  Each time I begin a project such as this blog, Ms. Fate steps in and says “oh since you’re busy doing a load of laundry, you wouldn’t mind doing these other 2 or 3 loads too, wouldn’t you?”  That is an analogy basically stating that everything comes crashing down on your head exactly at the moment when you want or need to start doing something for yourself.  It happens to me CONSTANTLY.  “Oh, so this happens to me just NOW and not some other time” is a phrase I hear coming out of my mouth a lot.  Blame work.  A
