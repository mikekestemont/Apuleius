Well this post is a little late, but since i'm moving my parents did somehting horrible. MY COMPTUER HAS BEEN PACKED UP AUGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! So i went to the party a little late. Another friend invited me to go somewhere and for some reason my dad said yes to that. SO i didnt get back until 10 where i promptly said goodnight, went to my room emptied my backpack, refilled it and left out the front door. Amazing how simple it was. Anyway the party was fun. There were 3 TVs set up with different Video games and we played magic alot. No shortage of food, drinks, or girls making out with eachother. Can't name names, but if you were there you knwo anyway, so HA. that'll teach you not to be inviited to parties. Anyway i left at 8:30 the next morning went in the GARAGE door, you know the really noisey one, went to my room and fell asleep. My parents did not even notice i had left. well that was a good time, which is why this post is labeled ROX instead of SUX, catch teh subtle change there? anyway SQUIRRELS RULE, and goodnight

Well this is my first attempt at any type of journal. Baisically my dad's in the military and we jsut got notified that we have to move to korea at the end of my school year which is may 27 and only 2 weeks away! Then i got a few C's on my report card so he goes psycho and grounds me till we move. Hes already cutting off the first real important social life i've had. I mean i've always had friends where we were stationed(germany, minnesota, washington, texas), but this is the first time i've had a lot of friends. One of my good friends is having a party and 2 days after he tells me about is when my dad grounds me. It was going to be my last party before i move and never see my friends again. Well i've just made a decision in my life.....Screw my parents. They've c
