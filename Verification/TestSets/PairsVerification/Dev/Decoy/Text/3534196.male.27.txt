market comments   urlLink City of Heroes  MMORPG  urlLink fansite   urlLink Star City Games   That's about it... If I had to urge someone to visit one of those sites it would be paulgraham.com  The man is a fascinating author and essayist and everyone should read his articles entitled,  urlLink "Why nerds are unpopular"  and  urlLink "What you can't say".   For the record, I'm going to take flak from my friend Andy for not recommending his site (brogdon.org) to visit.  PUT MORE CONTENT ON IT!  You big dork...   If you're interested in magic the gathering you can read some of my articles on starcitygames.com (look for articles by Jeff Hall)
Hrmm... I don't know if this will turn out to be interesting or just a random whim of mine but here goes.

We've tried several different strategies but nothing seems to work... Very frustrating... just wanted to vent...  Onto other stuff.  Still in the land of the unemployed... Truth be told the job hunting hasn't been real heavy yet... I'll probably really start into it this week.  We've had alot of interest in our house but no more offers (after getting screwed the the first time).  Hopefully we'll get things taken care of soon and be settled shortly therafter but we'll see.  I also got a call from the COO of Hancock telling me many flattering things and asking if I need any recommendation letters and what not.
