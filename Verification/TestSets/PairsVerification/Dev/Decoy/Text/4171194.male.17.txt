hire whores for ‘health benefits’. And all this in stunning 3D graphics! This game was, for the average male gamer, the equivalent of multiple orgasms to female.  Of course, parents took up their pickets and protested against the violence and shit, because that’s what parents do. And then the  GTA3  thing died down. Why? Because  GTA: Vice City  was coming out. They obviously didn’t want to make it look like they were remodelling the  GTA3  engine, so they made it look like an expansion pack. Anyway, this took place in the 80’s, and once again gamers pleasured themselves, but this time to Michael Jackson tunes (Alec pleasures himself to MJ tunes daily).  And then there comes  GTA4 . Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m looking forward to this game as much as the next nerd, but for Christ’s sakes, I feel like I’m going to be disappointed. Call it a sixth sense, but I feel like I’m looking at what will be an empty carcass of a game.  Let’s start off with something that really bugs me about this game. The size. It makes the bold statement of saying it will be three cities large and will be “somewhere between five and six times bigger than Vice City”. I find it hard to believe that the PS2 engine can handle this. Even with  Vice City , the machine seemed to have essential troubles keeping up with the flow of the game, and you’d sometimes see through roads etc. And with the enhanced graphics in  San Andreas , how the fuck can Rockstar even HOPE to keep the game running smoothly?   Now ok, let’s say they manage to pull the impossible off, there are concerns I have to do with the actual play engine. Let me start this paragraph off like a blunt cunt. I hate realism. I feel that gaming should let you do whatever the hell you like, whether it be racing through a forest as a blue hedgehog or stomping on mushrooms as an Italian plumber. With this said, I think the Weight and Exercise system in  San Andreas  is bollocks. The whole idea of you actually having to eat to not look like an Ethiopian bugs me. And the fact that if you eat too much and don’t exercise you’ll look like Anna Nicole Smith did a while ago. WHY BOTHER?  Finally, because I’m getting tired, the music. Since this game is set in the early 90’s, this means AC/DC, Ice Cube, and the Beach Boys. Now, don’t get me wrong, the Beach Boys is great, if you’re making a  Pee Wee Herman Driving Simulator  but otherwise I just can’t imagine myself killing people to that brand of music.
