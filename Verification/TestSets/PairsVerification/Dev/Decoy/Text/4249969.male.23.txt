just finish watching it, not what i have expected from it, initially thought was just another poor guy caught in the middle of a cross fire at the wrong place and at the wrong time, but it turn out to have more depth than other films in the same genre. it encompass the night of a taxi driver who accidentally have a passenger at the back of his car which turns out to be a professional hit man, yes ladies and gentlemen, introducing ....hollywoods golden boy Tom Cruise. the conversations between the two were funny and witty but at the same times consists the harsh truth of reality in the city we live in today. it may not be L.A here, but same things happen in every corner of the streets, only different level of seriousness.  in their conversation, tom cruise say that a man dies in a MTA, which i guess is something similar to our LRT, only be realized and found after a long time, i forgot how long was it. i could relate to that, as it reminds me of my days in kl apiit, i see all sorts of people walking by, brushing shoulders with me, we dodge each other and never have eyes contact...we are all too preocuppied with our things to realized there are sufferings and pain arround us.  one scene from the movie gave me an deep impression, where a wolf crossed the street just infront of their taxi, both of them with wonder and confuse expression on their faces, it seems like the director is trying to tell the audience the loneliness of tom cruise, regardless what is his occupation, he is a predator, like a wolf, yet not belongs to the city but the woods. we are all the same, we are all predators of our own society, we grab and snatch every opportunity we sees, we raise up as we step on the weaks, kill and destroy anyone who steps in our way, then, in the end... we lost ourselves...
i haven't actually done anything untill now, so many homework waiting for me to be done, but i ignore it. i'm confused and dazed, i don't know why do i have this kind of attitude, why am i so lazy? i just couldn't concentrate on my studies. oh GOd, please help me to go through this time of desparation and confusion, help me think clearly with Your wisdom and grace. please be with me and help me walk through the valley of death.   i cried, i cried because i felt lonely, the reason was i can't do my things properly, i tried to occupy my mind with homework but i fail, the more i indulge myself in stories and novel, the more lonely i felt. i don't want to feel lonely, i know God is always with me, and i
