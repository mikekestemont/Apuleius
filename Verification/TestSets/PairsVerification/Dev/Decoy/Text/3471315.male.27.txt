WOW, i had never really watched Gilmore Girls before last night, but I must admit its an oddly compelling show. I have a large head so I should not really talk but it seems to me that the daughter has a forehead out of Frankenstein or something. I placed small bets with myself to see if any point she would make a sudden movement and fall over on herself.   You know what`s diffferent about NBA playoff coverage in the US and abroad?

Oui from Brazil or Ahlo i suppose which some people also get away with. for a long time I was updating  urlLink this site  with info but that is not really likely with my current limitations at work. anyway, new feature   DUMB AMERICAN MOVE OF THE DAY   walked into a tapas restaurant last nite hoping to find some people speaking spanish to spare myself getting laughed out of a restaurant again. I placed an order and got a plate of cold cuts when i expected something more closely resembling, you know, tapas. Whatever my f
