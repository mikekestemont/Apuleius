That is all that is going through my head right now.  Why does it have to be like this?  Why didn't I do this or that?  Why didn't she say this or that?  Why?  Why?  Why?!  This is the most awful thing I have ever been through in my life.  Maybe I'm just being overly dramatic but maybe I'm not.  All I know is that it sucks, it hurts and I wouldn't wish any of it on my worst enemy.  I wish I had all the answers or at least knew what to say to make it all better....
I was telling Stacey the other night that until October of 2001 I had never known anyone in my life that I could stand to be around 24/7.  October of 2001 was when my friendship with a certain Ms. Fowler began.  She's someone that I can be around every second of the day and never think that I need to get away or have a minute to myself.  I know everyone needs some "me" time every now and then, but I've needed less of that since I met her.    That says a lot if you ask me......    Funny word of the day:    urlLink callipygian
Not that I didn't know this before....but this crappy experience has only reinforced what kick ass friends and family I have.  Thanks for being there for me and listening to me babble.    Word of the day:    urlLink maladroit
How come I can see it all from a new perspective now?  I feel like I'm seeing things from her eyes for the first time.  Does that make me a bad person?  Or was I really just that stubborn?  And does she really believe me when I say that I can see it from her perspective?  I don't think she does.  It would  have  to make a huge difference if she did.  I feel like I need to scream or break something.  I know it won't fix things but I'm so frustrated right now.  I also feel like I'm going to go crazy.  Every e-mail and phone call I've received in the last week has brought a faint hope that it was her writing/calling to tell me she had changed her mind and that everything was going to be OK.    I still can't believe she is doing this.  It's not getting any easier.  If I wasn't half numb right now I don't think I could even get out of bed.  It is a true living hell.

I always thought I was one of those solitary people that could spend the rest of their life alone if they had to.  I've definitely learned in the last year or so that is not the case anymore.  There is one person I want to spend the rest of my life with.  It's totally my loss that she doesn't feel the same way.  I almost feel like I'm starting to go on and on about all of this.  But at the same time I feel like crap and need to get i
