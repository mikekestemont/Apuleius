- focus on one thing.  A deep hole (the one you make while waiting for the long stick) signifies focus.  Tetris teaches me that in order to succeed... I need to focus on one thing at a time.  Make too many holes and you're not going to last long. - flexibility... If your in a tight fix (pieces stacked up too high) you make use of what you have to cut your losses to extend your game... Example if you have one big hole (while waiting for the long piece) you can use the L or the opposite L to make a double or triple to extend your game.  It also teaches you that sometimes you have to sacrifice those goals (covering the big holes) momentarily... Because you have to do it to survive.  Things will clear up soon when you get the pieces you need. - Z and S although they're not as desirable can be useful too.  This teaches me to accept pieces (i.e. people) for who they are and to admit that they can be a good thing. A Z or an S can complete a line enough to make a double or a triple (if next piece is an L). - it's always good to get things done right away and not let things pile up.  As things pile up... You grow desperate, making more mistakes. - tetris teaches me not to dwell on mistakes but to accept them and move on.  Dwelling on mistakes distracts you and you're more than like to create more mistakes on top of that.  Especially as you go to higher levels since the pieces fall faster. - tetris taught me how to be decisive... Because indecision will mean game over. - the value of planning ahead... 'yung piece preview... If you know what lies ahead you can maximize your accomplishments.  Knowing what will come next means getting a double, triple, or a tetris depending on how you use your current piece now to prepare yourself better for the next piece.  The list doesn't end here... There are a lot more lessons to learn!... Depende sa level or handicap (i.e. there are unfinished rows already when you start the game)... And different levels or handicap requires a different frame of mind from you in order to succeed.  Example: If you start the game with 0 handicap... Then your objective is to build big blocks... To maximize the opportunity to make tetris.  But if you have a large handicap... You need to work on things one at a time. Sometimes you need to take a step back because the pieces you're dealt with doesn't fit... But you just have to be patient and work on things bit by bit.  Learn from something small to prepare ourselves for something big. Dran  &nbsp; urlLink
