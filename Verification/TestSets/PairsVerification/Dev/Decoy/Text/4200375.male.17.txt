I see The face of evil trying to take Reality away from me. Please, Please Just let me be alone, I can't believe How could you be so mean to me? How could you try to pass it by As if I didn't notice. If I could I would change every thing about that day The way you had to lie and hide. The way I treated you like you were not my love But now I want to be alone. Just let Me be. Just let me be in loneliness. The pain inside has turned into my life. I really want to leave it all behind, The more I see your face, the more I want To be alone. Because it's all I have. It's all I have, my love just leave. I need To Be alone to think about where we Now stand. I see that time we spent is gone, And now I want to be in here alone.
This is going to be a story about a banana. I told my friend JR to write about a banana slowly rotting because he wanted to write about something, he declined, but told me to. So then i'm going to use it as a pseudo-metaphor for society, and the American family...i promise, i don't really mean that.  Laying on a plate that you have no respect for, thinking that you are the best part of anyone's life. Feeling great. Knowing, just knowing that someone will enjoy you, be able to take away your outer self and see the inside, the real you. As moments pass by you must control your state of mind, reassuring yourself that someone will be there for you, but time passes on. As Days pass you must convince yourself that someone will be there for you...soon. Signs of age have set in and you know that your not as attractive at you once were, the chances of companionship decrease with each passing second. This time will pass, everyone loves bananas, they will hold me in their hands and pull me close...enjoy every part of my body. But yet you wait, and nothing happens. Feeling ill, feeling less. Signs of wear are exploding from your face, and you don't even appreciate yourself now. The plate, once so insignificant to you, is now the only friend you have. You give up your thoughts of love, knowing your time will never come. The slightest touch from another restores once lost hope, until they too cast you aside in the garbage. You see only dark from the bottom of a well. Feeling nothing.  That would be the whole banana thing...now JR, write your version of a banana.
Well, here we are...the first day of my blog. Wow, i'm not really excited about any of this. I think that anything i say will have no effect on your life, not make you think, nor will it help me fell good in anyway, but it just a thought. So i'll probably do some updating eventually, not that i think anyone is reading i
