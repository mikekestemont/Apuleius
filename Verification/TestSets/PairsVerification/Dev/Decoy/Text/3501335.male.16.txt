Wai Hong. Sasi was the first to go home, next I drop by at Azim's house with him and realized that my keys were really missing. I felt slightly pissed - both at myself and him but at that time I was too tired to care. I thought that I'd find it early morning the next day.  Three plastic bags not belonging to me were left at Auntie Wendy's car boot - I had to bring them back to my house. I felt sick, felt tired. I didn't even feel like using the leg massager my parents recently bought (earlier while setting up the gadget, Shawn massaged WH's leg and WH said he felt soo much better. I wanted Shawn to massage me immediately after that, but then he asked to use the leg massager I had so skeptically dismissed - that it would really work wonders. Azim said, " Ish, aku ni sekarang pun rasa nak guna   massager  tu la,"  after listening to the massaging tales.)  After showering, I tuned in to The Corrs' Borrowed Heaven album, set the Sleep mode and flopped onto my bed. It felt so much better. 4 hours of sleep and hours of strenous work. My bed was my heaven.  Today (Sunday) - 1st August 2004  Woke up at 6 something, Azim phoned me saying he found my keys inside his file. Yay ^.^ I slept back for about 15 minutes, before waking up and eat my breakfast while using the massager. My poor legs felt better. I arrived late at 7:15am at school only to find that the  perbarisan  was over - I stood next to Shawn who was commanding and followed his final instruction -  keluar baris ! XD  I wore by brand-new Nike Air Max Turbulence, it felt sooo comfy and light that when I put that pair into my bag, I felt like I was carrying nothing. The  Larian Mesra  run was supposedly 7km, but when I ran it didn't feel like 7km, unlike previous years' SJ10K runs. I twisted my ankle a little when I accidentally slipped my leg into the tiny drain-hole. I can't catch up with WH, I felt too tired. Kai Shen ran past me.  I rested at several intervals, and went past Ramesh - our  olahragawan ! I felt proud of it XD although I understand that Ramesh is only exceptionally good at short-distance runs. I got number 13, and I felt it was an achievement 'cause I thought I'd lose (I even planned on just walking and enjoy the walk, 'cause I thought winning it was impossible). I think it's mainly due to many students were not there or even running.  That's about it. I got so close at lucky draw - my number being B4101 while Daniel, whose number was B4102 got it >.<>_>).  I suppose this is my longest blog post ever, writing from 6:29 pm (while chatting to Heng Li and other people), ate my dinner then continue it till now, 9:12 pm. The title says it all, I'm fucking tired. X
