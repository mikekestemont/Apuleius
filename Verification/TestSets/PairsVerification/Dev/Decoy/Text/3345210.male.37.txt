to suggest that I expected privacy in a web blog.  It was not privacy, nor even anonymity, that I expected.  Inconsequentiality perhaps.  I imagined I was lost in the crowd, that nothing I said or did would make any difference or be noticed.  Which, in its own way, gave me freedom, the illusion of privacy.  I could write whatever I wished.  I learned several years ago the joy of having an intimate pen pal, a confidante with whom I can share everything (now I have several such persons).  It is like an interactive diary, in a way.  Often I write something to a friend, expressing my innermost thoughts and feelings, thoughts and feelings from so deep within myself that I am not aware of them, do not understand them, until I see them written in a letter to a friend.  A blog is both like and unlike that.  One writes, behind an anonymous  nom de plume , not knowing the identities of the few or many readers whom one contacts.  But now, I cannot deny that the readers exist.  I have been told, in no uncertain terms, "You are not alone."  But how am I to feel about that?  I am surprised by my sense of duty, of obligation.  The show must go on!  Ahh, my public, my loyal readership.  I feel bound to produce, and it better be good!  I must entertain, educate, edify.  I feel all the anxieties of any human in public--what have I done?  Is it good enough?  Must I do more?  So, thank you, Olive!  If you are ever in Portland, there is a little tea shop in the Belmont neighborhood called the Tao of Tea.  Great little place, very intimate, warm atmosphere.  Excellent variety of tea and Indian quisine, good prices.  Whatever you get, order a side dish of calamatas--they are exquisite.

I am back.  I could use the fact that my computer has been in the shop as an excuse for recent silence, but really it's just focus on other things.  Jesus said to Thomas, "Blessed are those who have not seen, yet believe."  I would say that goes for people like  urlLink Wendy  who are able to believe in something divine even though they don't have a pre-packaged, ready-made, air-tight theology to explain it.  Those who insist on such fundamental air-tightness are, in my mind, doubters.  It's the agnostics who are the real faithful.  They show the real trust, that God will give them whatever info and guidance they need to live rightly, but no m
