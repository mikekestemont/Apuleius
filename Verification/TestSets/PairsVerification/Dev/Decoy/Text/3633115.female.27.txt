What is it about  urlLink Froot Loops  that make them taste so good?  Is it the five pounds of sugar, the various color additives, perhaps just the round, donut like shape?  Perhaps the allure is that of Toucan Sam.  Who doesn't like a talking bird telling you to eat his cereal.  I think I know.  It was the fact that I was deprived of this particular cereal as a child and now, cannot get enough of them.  Yep, that must be it.  That or they use crack/cocaine in lieu of sugar.
I don't claim to be all knowing in the world of English.  I actually consider myself to be quite ignorant.  However, I do know that there are certain things about people that really irritate me.  The primary thing that bugs me is people who refuse to speak English properly.  English is really not that difficult.  You don't need to know what a dangling modifier is or what a participle is, but one really should know the difference between "well" and "good."  I hope to some day be an English teacher to junior high school children.  Glutton for punishment some may say.  I just hope to instill some appreciation for proper English.  Being from Texas is not an excuse to say that a toy is "broke" rather than saying a toy is "broken."  I cannot stand that my mother in law, who teaches third grade, does not know the difference between "well" and "good."  She is a teacher for heaven's sake.  No wonder our public school system is so awful.  If the teacher's cannot practice what they teach, then how are they to expect a student to practice what they are taught?  Furthermore, saying something such as this is the year two thousand  and  four is WRONG.  A serious pet peeve of mine.  The year is two thousand four.  And is indicative of using a decimal point. A good example is when one writes a check.  If the amount for the check is $5.25, then one should write five  and  25/xx (or 00 whatever) dollars.  Okay, I think I am now done ranting.  Though this may come up again, as I tend to lose it after a time of witnessing such carelessness when using the (American) English language.
I now have 5 $100 bills in my hand.  S sold our non-functioning mustang today.  These people actually paid money to buy a car that doesn't work, and they are going to find the trailer to come and get it.  Some folks are just nuts.  All I care about is the $500 I have that is terribly burning a hole in my pocket.  Ahh...the voice of reason and practicality is speaking to me once again. ( pay the bills )  Stupid reality.
I think suffer from some weird form of insomnia.  I consume almost no caffine at all. I try to eat healthy and on a regular basis. I exercise in the mornings.  Yet, somehow, I am plagued by a likely nonexistent form of insomnia that doesn't allow me to sleep regardless of how exhuasted I
