I just got back from Johor. Feel a bit tired. I had this migraine since I went back Johor. I dont know what the hell happened to my brain. Until now, I still have it.. Argh!! Feels like to chop my head off!! I feel a bit emotional for two days. I keep thinking about the things that happend last time. Fuck man!! I should not think about it.. I almost cried think about it.. Ohh sometimes I wish I never been born.. I feel I gained weight.. Put on a kilo i think. Havent go to gym for almost a week. Shit!! Now I feel so conscious about my weight... Damn!! I have to mantained my weight after months to shed 20+kg off.. I'm not gonna be a fat again.. Karen C smsed me, but I dont have creadit to reply. Bout something, she need help.. I wish I could reply to her now, tomorrow first thing in morning! I need sleep, my head really aching.. Shit! If only I know what is wrong in my head.  K guys.. Nite..
I missed 2 days of posting.. I'm not lazy..  My PC was really lagging last few days, after installing Norton Internet Security. If you guys think that a good program.. Don't you ever think about to install it.!! It makes your PC lag like hell. So I uninstall it, then all the problem start. I can't log in my MSN Messenger, my connection slows down and my PC still lag, then last night at 12am I started to reformat my hard disk and reinstall win xp. For past 2 days, there so much things going on. My gym mates missed me, coz for past few days I prefer to come in morning, so we didnt meet, the reason, I having class in da afternoon and there something to do in the evening. Last thursday, I went to watch movie with Karen L, "Day After Tomorrow" or in translation "Lusa".. I was a good movie. Arghh!! My mum called again asking me about working.. I hate that!! It ticked me!! She keep asking me about it.. It's not like I didnt look for jobs, I'm waiting for call, damn this people, when they gonna start calling me..  SO MUM PLEASE STOP NAGGING ME!! DONT MAKE ME NOT PICK UP UR CALL!! I think she's a bit stress out coz my brother getting marry next week, and he's gonna start studying, he's been out of job for 3 months now, and she didnt nag him, I just finished my study for less than a month.. and she nags me like I'm jobless for 2 years.. Hey, when my brother just finish his, he was jobless for 3 months, working for almost a year, then quit,when back johor, jobless more than 6 months, but she didnt nag.. but why to me!! I'm going back BP today, i'm not sure how's my feeling.. I dont have a joy feeling of going back at all. Maybe if I got a job, and having a life h
