03.24.03          Just this morning I was at work and fidgeting.  I worry about every day as though it’s my last I tend to over do everything.  I still look at the pictures from my trip Asheville like a tiger looking at national geographic from its cage.  I run my fingers over the photos wondering if this place was all just a dream.  Sanity is the word of the day I tend to spend the rest of this week taking back my sanity from those people who are intent on taking it. My whole life is one big count down if it’s not one thing it’s another every day the clock starts anew and there I am back at square one.

Someone along the way also mention that you can always remember the bad times even if it’s out numbered by the good. It’s true though I’d like to think that the reason you remember the bad times is because it’s so traumatic. To laugh or to fall in love is not traumatic however, breaking up or crying is.   With that said my birthday is Saturday I have decided not to say a word about it every year before this one I’d always get excited and all giddy. I’d run around and tell my parents what I wanted, get all my friends calendars clear so we could hang out and just get down right excited. This year I turn 22 so I’m past the sweet 16’s and the great 18 and the terrific 21. Those memories are what I like to call traumatic. I spent all those birthdays alone except for one lucky 21.I met a girl 2 months prior she was cute, talented, sweet and taken. She only hung out with me for an hour or so but she really made my night even though I spent the rest of it roaming a
