be "activists" and the others will be the "Ate Charo's". I'm one of the Charo's...the  aktibista  role is just not my thing. Well, it rained, yes, but the Bigkasers still rocked the day.  Syndrome of the Moment: the "Today-was-so-far-the-best-Sabayan-practice" Syndrome        GARFIELD.  We watched Garfield yester day!!! It's so cool. Although I freaked out for some scenes (FYI, I'm afraid of cats. Weird? Hehe.) but the film was cute. I honestly enjoyed it.    --  Watch out for:  Garfield's dance moves and all his other wacky pranks!!!   --  I watched it at:  Festival Mall, last night   --  Rating: ( 5 stars as the highest) **** - I could've given it a 5 but the fear factor is there...hehe       NOT YOUR TYPICAL BABY.  It's my new blog. It's where I'm gonna talk about issues and stuff that I don't wanna place in this blog because they're not "related" to my life, but it kinda bugs me anyway. Haha. Hope you got that.  Basta , visit it, just click   urlLink  this   . Tell me what you think of it okay?      Gotta go now, I still need to make reco letters...luv yah! and don't forget:  COMMENT!!!!!!!
TODAY I FEEL:   loved...teehee     EAR CANDY:   she will be loved...        I don't mind spending everyday     Out on your corner in the pouring rain     Look for the girl with the broken smile     Ask her if she wants to stay awhile     And she will be loved...she will be loved       Oh it's stuck in my mind. But the question is: who will be loved? Me -- with a huge question mark? Honestly, I feel loved right now...loved by you. Haha. I LOVE this feeling. But not love as in boyfriend-girlfriend love, but the "I-can-feel-the-world" feeling. It's nice. Love is loving me right now.       BOOK FAIR.  We went to the World Trade Center Book Fair today, and boy am I overwhelmed!!! As you all know, I'm a total book-anaconda! But I'm no nerd, mind you. I just love the smell of books and the thought every page brings. It's awesome. I can't believe how people take books for granted...they don't even dare read a book or two. They're missing a huge part of their life. We bought the 5th installment of the Princess Diaries: Princess in Pink. It's so -- PINK. Kee-yut.  Syndrome of the Moment: the "Books-are-cool-and-so-am-I" syndrome        ROSITA.  My second name, as all of you know is something I'm really proud of. Yeah it sounds weird but it sounds wonderful next to my name.  Maria Karla Rosita.  Heavenly *wink* So for our assignment in Soc Sci, we have to research the meaning and heritage of our names. Rosita is an Italian word for small rose. Rose (Rosa) means pink. So sort of like "small pink rose". Cool, huh? I guess that explains my pink addiction.  Syndrome of the Moment: the "My-name-is-so-pink-and-rosy" syndrome.        HEARTTHROB.  I changed the title of the blog. I really like the word. Think it suits me? Naaahh. You judge. Basta, I think it fits this blog. Tell me watcha think, okay?!      Comments guys! Keep it coming! Luv yah, mwaaahh!!! :
