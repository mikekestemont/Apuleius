  The PCH is beautiful at five-thirty or six in the morning. The ocean smells the best at that time and there are basically no cars on the road. I recommend listening to jazz when you make the drive at that hour. Once I drove the 27 miles that is Malibu, I got off on Hueneme Road and drove through Oxnard and Ventura County. I decided I would head into Santa Barbara before coming back. I would have gone so far as Big Sur and possibly the Monterey Peninsula, but I don’t like to rush that trip. And there wasn’t enough time to do it anyway, since I had to be at a party and I was still a bit worried about not accomplishing any work. Soon though, as I wove my way down the PCH, I stopped stressing about losing those hours to work. I stopped in for a coffee someplace in Ventura County, by the Naval Base, called the Friends Café. The coffee was a little weak but there was something nice about the place. The people that sat outside eating their omelettes and drinking their weak coffee were not like the people in LA who crowd the sidewalks for weekend brunch. They weren’t like the hipsters in Los Feliz with their egg whites and their power fruit salads. These people seemed unaffected. They seemed happy. If I wasn’t on a schedule I might have stayed but I ordered my coffee to go instead and I got back in the car. I made my way to the border of Santa Barbara by about ten fifteen or ten-thirty. I drove around a while and started to head back the other way – back to the place I was from. Before I left I ordered another coffee, this time from Starbucks. I had gone through a couple of CDs on my trip – a jazz CD and then a Willie Nelson CD. On the way back to Los Angeles though I listened to Santa Barbara and Ventura’s NPR station, which was pleasant because they didn’t seem to have as many people on the radio with faux British accents. A woman was interviewing a travel writer who was based in Santa Barbara and divided his time between his home there and Japan. He was telling listeners that they should look at the place they live as though they were foreigners, so they could see it differently, as though they had new eyes. I think there’s a lot of weight to a philosophy like that.  I made it back to LA around two o’clock. I took unfamiliar roads home and I got a bit lost, but I didn’t mind. When I got to Marina del Rey I went swimming in the ocean before getting ready for the party. I saved my work for Sunday and got quite a lot done. I was thinking a lot more clearly, even though I still had seawater in my ears. Next weekend I think I’ll go swimming again before I begin working on my application for the S
