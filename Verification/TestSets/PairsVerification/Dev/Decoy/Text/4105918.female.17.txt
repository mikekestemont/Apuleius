Dear God! I fucking love you gill gill! You have engendered me with ME! You are me! I am not myself without you. I cant be. Without you i am nothing. Without you i am an empty body, i am a void waiting to be filled. Your like a sweet drug, filling my veins with beatitude and effervescent eternal laughter and joy. Gill gill never leave me. You are my life. Someday we will live together on L squat and be forever in a state of immutable bliss. Everything you touch, gill gill, is cool. You are beautiful and you are better then anyone has ever even strived to be and donâ€™t let anyone let you think otherwise. -Tokyo     p.s. I love you.
