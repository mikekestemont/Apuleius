in Burley near to Ilkley and have done for most of my life.  I work in Bradford and have to say that it's a much maligned place, but to be honest with you, it's a much nicer place than Leeds.
....at long last I've managed to get back online.&nbsp; The failed attempt to get broadband also saw my computer decide that it didn't want to accept my dial up modem, but much banging of head, and no small amount of help from DSP Andy helped me sort the problem.&nbsp; I've editted my registry and now it works, hurrah.&nbsp; So I shall attempt to catch up on some of the last month that I have been off the air so to speak.   &nbsp;
Abject apologies for not posting for nearly 2 months, firstly my modem packed up, then we went to France for 2 weeks on holiday, more of which later.&nbsp; When we got back from holidays I placed an order for Wanadoo (formerly freeserve) broadband at the bargain basement price of 17.99 a month for 512k bandwidth with a maximum of 2 gig download a month.&nbsp; Well if you ring up to place an order, no problems, phone answered within 2 or three rings.&nbsp; If however you ring to enquire as to why three weeks later you still haven't received anything then it's 43 minutes and some irritating bint saying they'll be with you soon, NO they won't!&nbsp; So anyway it'll be along to the local computer shop ccl in Tong for a 9 quid modem and I'll stick with my 56K dial up thanks very much.

"I'm working on the building site across theroad", explains the duck. Then the duck drinks his beer, eats his sandwich and leaves. This continues for 2 weeks. Then one day the circus comes to town.  The ringleader of the circus comes into the pub and the landlord says to him, "You're with the circus aren't you? I know this duck that would be just brilliant in your circus, he talks, drinks beer and everything! "Sounds marvellous", says the ringleader, "get him to give me a call". So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the landlord says, "Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money!". Yeah?", says the duck, "Sounds great, where is it?". At the circus", says the landlord. The circus?", the duck enquires. That's right", replies the landlord. The circus?. That place with the big tent?. With all the animals?  With the big canvas roof with the hole in the middle", asks the duck. That's right!", says the landlord. The duck looks confused,     "What the heck would they want with a p
