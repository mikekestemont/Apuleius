The day after the night in which Lulo finished his story, he gave it to Cuco before Cuco left for work and told Cuco to read the story on the train. Lulo set himself to work, hoping that things would turn out as he desired. Lulo filled the bathtub with warm water. He denuded himself and placed himself in it. Next to him, he had placed a very sharp knife. He soaked in the warm water for a little while and cried. Finally he took the knife and slit his wrists. The blood flowed from his wrists and made the water an awful crimson red.   Cuco read this on the train, on his way to work. He was stunned. He thought that perhaps Lulo would not do such a terrible thing. Lulo had told Cuco that he would visit his mother that day. Cuco did not know for certain. That is the point. One never knows what another is feeling or thinking for certain. Cuco thought it was crazy but he got off the train and called the house. No one answered the phone. Then Cuco called Lulo’s mobile phone. There was no answer. Cuco got off the train he was on at the next stop and took a cab back home. When he arrived at home, he walked in the house and ran to the washroom where he found Lulo’s body in the bathtub filled with blood red water. Now Cuco could not believe what he was seeing, it was so awful. Cuco called the ambulance.   Lulo wanted Cuco to tell his family that he loved them very much, and that he was very sorry for everything he had done. Lulo wanted Cuco to know that he loved him very much, but that after this very bad thing in his life, it was hard to live. He could no longer live, and this was why he took his own life.   The gargoyle showed no emotion on his face that day. He neither smiled nor frowned. He kept a straight face. But a tear did drop from his cold stone eye. And this is a very sad thing indeed, if it made a thing made of stone shed a tear.
One being one is more than enough.  Two together, one at last, two of a kind, three.  Perhaps there is finding and seeking and opening and closing.  Perhaps.  Forward is always better than fish, and fish is better than blame, but not better than oil.  Blame is a simple word, there is no other one than that for good and for sweet.  Sweetly sweetly, smell your skin, sweetly sweetly, smell.
He was one looking.   He was one sitting.  He was one looking and sitting and listening.  He was one listening.  There were things.  He was one listening to things while looking and sitting.  He was one who was fat.  He was one who was fat and sitting while looking and listening to things.  He was one who was fat.  He was one who was not always fat.  He is now fat and a
