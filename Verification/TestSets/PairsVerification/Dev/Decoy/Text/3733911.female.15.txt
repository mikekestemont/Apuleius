again. So yea.. It prolly will be another few days til I write once again in here.  *~*Steph*~*
BORED!! I dunno wat to say so yea..
My teeth still hurt like hell. But Im getting used to the braces now. So yea, I was very bored today. I had to wake up early today, but hey I got to go see Spiderman 2, my dad got free tickets from his work. It was really good. I think I like the first one better tho. Most movies the first one is always better. But oh well. I didnt go to the movies yesterday with Ash, Court and Dann. Oh well my mom was like why dont u forget bout the movie today and Ill jus take you to see him. I was shocked when she said that too. So I was like ok, n the thing was she knew his mom wasnt home, well thats the part where she shocked me at, she actually let me go over my boyfriends house without and parents around. Well he had an interesting time there. Too bad we didnt have the fuzzy handcuffs or anything tasty around. Oh well maybe someother time.lol. But yea. Im bored now. haha the braces dont interfere either..lol..my aunt asked me that already before I had them on. It's pretty funny cuz my family keeps asking me does the braces interfere cuz Dann has braces too. I jus laugh at them. I still cant believe my mom asked the dentist that tho. Oh well. I guess Im gonna stop writing now.   _-Later-_
Got braces today, teeth hurt like hell. Feels like their gonna fall out.. Bored.. Bye.._-later-_
YAY! thats my lil joke.. well not really but yea. AHH! Today was the last day my teeth are normal, cuz tomorrow I go to work then go to the dentist and get braces. Oh well its life. But I dunno. Im gonna try to go over Dann's tomorrow after I get home so I can see him before he leaves for the weekend. Im gonna miss him soo much! OMG tonight some random guy IMs me sayin all this shit n I dunno, so I got Dann to IM him n he shut up after that. It was pretty funny, I kept sayin how the hell did u get my s/n and he would say nothing. That fucking asshole can go fuck his cat. But ne ways. Im bored. I should be in bed rite now cuz I gotta wake up early and go to work, but Im not tired and I dont feel like doing that, so OH WELL. ladedadeda   _-Later-_
