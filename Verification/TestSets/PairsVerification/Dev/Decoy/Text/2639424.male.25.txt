corner store for $100. Rent a limo if you getta pink slip on yo' job. Just rent one once   Sidebar:  Dont you hate when people argue about who's gonna ride in or who shoulda rode in the family car at the funeral? Maybe its just me   *You gotta walk Butt-Naked in your house.  I havent done this and cant come to grips with doing it but its so necessary. I dont even walk barefoot in my house so I know butt-naked is gonna be a major accomplishment for me. I just be scared that Im a bump into something and damage my goods. Ya know...........you might close the refrigerator door and close "yourself" in the door as well.   *Fellas, you gotta have a BAD female admiring you from afar.  I mean she gotta have a mean crush on you and you not even know. I mean, SHE dont even know why, she just feelin you. I aint had that happen to me, but if any ladies feel that way about me..... sallimo@hotmail.com   ....... Hit me! I would give you my cell phone but it might be cut off next week   Sidetip:  Never save the number of a DC person under 25 in your phonebook. If they are truly DC resident and they are under 25 they dont keep phones long man!   *Ladies, you gotta have a man serenade you in front of your female friends.

When you get married at 60, Intimacy is standing close when taking pictures. The honeymoon is watching Family Feud.   *Last but not least you gotta accept Jesus Christ in ya life.  Now there are Millions of religions. Im not pushing mines on anyone. We all have an open choice. So If you Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, or you just religiously watch NFL Games on Sunday, take this one how you like it. I wont argue wit you about who is right and who is wrong. We can do it like Jeopardy, write down your own answer but in the end we will know. None of us are perfect but Jesus loves you despite all of that. Plus Southeast DC aint got nothing on the Heat in Hell!   What more can I say "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin". Im out like a homeless man's toe in a s
