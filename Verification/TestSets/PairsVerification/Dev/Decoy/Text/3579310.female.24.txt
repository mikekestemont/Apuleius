Hey All.... Well just keeping you updated on my life My family is slowly piling into Egypt. I was just with my aunt and my cousins who have been taught to say that I am their favorite cousin. I can make them do anything I want by tickling them which is pretty cool. I am ruling the cousinship by force. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA (That was my sinister laugh). Well other than that.... Sherif is here from the states, not my brother, the friend of mine that I was so much in love with. He is telling me he wants us to meet now and see how things go with us and yadda yadda yadda.... You know sometimes you feel like it is too little too late. I wanted to hear that so badly last year but things were just the opposite. Now I am confused.... I feel like I really want it all to happen again but I am scared that things will end like they did before.... I have no clue what to do about Shazly either. He is such an amazing person and everything but then what..... Where will we be in 10 years.... nowhere. We will both be living our respective lives far away from eachother. Maybe a random e-mail every so often but I feel like that is all there will be. So why are things like this now? Why is this so hard? Why do I love the people I shouldn't? And then onto Nassef..... I guess another too little to late story. I do not know how I feel when I am taken for granted and then later on people are like "oh now I see that you are nice.... What do u say?" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH I just want to scream..... why can't you fucking see me before that????? And now I feel really weird and uncomfortable around him..... Cuz I feel like the apology was great but not good enough..... And so many other stories like this..... it sucks after a while. I used to love it, I used to love getting attention from guys... but now it pisses me off.... I just want to find that ONE guy I am supposed to find and live happily ever after.... I wanna stop taking the stops on the way..... Will I ever make it to that one person? When? How will I know? Will it be worth all of it? Have I already found him and by some mistake lost him? Will it be happy ever after like we are all taught to believe and dream of? Is there really something called happy ever after????  Well other than that I am doing well... just hanging out with the "aganab" (foreigners) that are here... This is a story, of 7 americans picked to live in Egypt.... They are all amazing; Scott - the person I should be able to hate so much but his arrogance just grows on ya ;o)) He also has that southern hospitality which is cool... Eric - just so sweet and kind... he could n
