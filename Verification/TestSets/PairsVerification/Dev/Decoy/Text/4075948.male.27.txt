it was explained to me (apologetically, mind) that they'd had an applicant who was better suited to the job than me, and they didn't think they could justify to the Home Office wanting to hire me instead of him.  I was left in the lurch in July, by which time most good teaching jobs had been filled. Luckily, the English faculty at the  urlLink Nottingham School of Education  were very supportive and appalled by the "disgraceful" treatment I'd received. My tutor made some calls and it turned out that  urlLink Lees Brook Community Sports College  in  urlLink Derby  were still looking for an English teacher. I went in, interviewed, taught an "audition" lesson, and was offered the job. Their head, a woman with a reputation for getting things done and getting her way, assured me she'd sort out the work permit.  But in order to receive the work permit, I'll have to send my  urlLink passport  in. If I haven't got my passport, I can't leave the country. And even though I'm still in possession of it, I am nervous about leaving the UK and then trying to re-enter before this is all official. So a holiday in the  urlLink US  is out.  However, the good news is that (as previously mentioned), Ms Pillsbury and I are off to  urlLink Ireland  tomorrow, since a passport is unnecessary in travelling between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It will be very good to get away for a bit. We fly from  urlLink Nottingham East Midlands Airport  to  urlLink Cork , from which we'll take a coach to  urlLink County Kerry  to meet two friends of ours who live in  urlLink Chicagoland ,  Mr and Mrs Leahy. We used to be team mates for a weekly quiz night at an  urlLink Irish pub  in  urlLink Elmhurst  and haven't seen them in a year. I'm really looking forward to seeing them and also to seeing Ireland, albeit briefly. Neither Ms Pillsbury nor I have been there before and we don't really know what to expect, since all the unfortunate stereotypes are undoubtedly exaggerations. Mr Leahy is an Irishman himself; I think it's always more enjoyable when travelling abroad to have a native of that country as a sort of "tour guide" so you can see what life there is really like.  All in all, it's too short a visit, but we can't really afford to stay in hotels for any extendeed period, what with the poverty of having just been full-time students for a year. Nevertheless, it should be more interesting than the typical summer holiday that seems to be de rigueur for the average  urlLink Englishman : spend a fortnight getting alarmingly red on some  urlLink Spanish island  full of other English people and consuming vast quantities of (probably English) lager.  So I'll report back on Ireland after my return on Friday, and sometime I'll explain how I came to be in the position of having done an English teacher training course and looking for work in the  urlLink East Midlands .
