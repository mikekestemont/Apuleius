listening to: the hives - b is for brutus  nothing thoroughly interesting, except that i'll start up my own website probably, if broedom continues at this rate ! well got my hair cut, because it used to be really and now it's really short, which is quite nice in summer, because it's not so hot and dries quicker after swimming, and after that i visited denise and sonja, for a good hour and a half and phoned around with flip and chris&nbsp; and thomas and sonja and arranging a meeting in the park, cora and bianca and markus 8 a drummer we got to know last week, really nice guy) and ralph were there too, again ! michi also came along (she is my neighbour and a friend of mine) and told us about her week in the czech republic !but this time we all&nbsp;went home earlier ! then watched the beginning of 'cats & dogs'&nbsp;at michi's house !&nbsp; next day i just sat around and watched the average '8 mile' and then went to see the highly anticipated 'spiderman 2' with sonja ! and then drove home by bus with her and had a long phone talk with michi because she was bored ! today i sat around again, played guitar, but got my glasses fixed, went to get the magazines more and the gap and a spiderman action figure, which i wanted to doat the last movie already, but they were sold at that time ! then got myself ice tea and listenend to fm4 and now i'm recapturing the previous days and right now i'm gonna call thomas and christian and ask what we're gonna do tonight ! cheers, thomas !    &nbsp;   &nbsp;
wow, at last, something to do ! last day for denise in graz because she'll go to italy for a week ! hmmm, what am i gonna do without having the chance to go for a walk ? anyway so we went to drink something at 'stern' (ice tea and summer just go hand in hand) and after thomas went, we wanted to walk around and ended up at the playground in the huge city park, and played around there ! later sonja and me had to drive back together by bus, because she was sleeping over at denise's house ! and our relationship is really strange, we used be really close friends and now we barely talk, and if about our school time together and about this guy who used to be my best friend, whom she meets regularly, but we found some subjects ! nothing more special, cheers, thomas !
listening to: the hives - love in plaster  oh god...from the promising and eventful start of this summer (or a s you might call it-raining time)&nbsp; it all went downhill, and now i sit around bored and do nothing mostly ! all i did on the last 5 weeks, was just play guitar, read and swim...i mean, yes, pretty cool i get to play a lot guitar but...everyday ? at least i do something a
