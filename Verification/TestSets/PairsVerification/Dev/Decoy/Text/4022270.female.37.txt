urlLink     caterpillars (day 6)   urlLink        The caterpillars are huge!!  We are all exhausted!  The boys are going to spend some time with their cousins and Papa and JoJo (my parents).  Dancin has been doing dinosaur dot to dots which are helping him count.  We have also worked on goldfish math.  Kai likes to count also- he is getting up to eight.  Kai is also getting his colors!
urlLink     the boys and their caterpillars (day 2)   urlLink          We are keeping a journal of the caterpillars as they grow. The last couple of days have been hectic due to Grandpa Harold's heart surgery (which he is recovering nicely from). Wednesday the 28th I flew out of the house at 7:30 to be at the hospital. The boys spent the day with JoJo (my mother) and Dancin went to camp. Thursday morning we did the calendar and the caterpillar journal before heading into NYC for a hospital visit. We read lots of books in the cafeteria (the boys could not visit). Dancin practiced counting to 100 with a number grid. He is so proud of himself! Friday we all went to the city after calendar and journal. The boys and I walked from Port Authority all the way crosstown to NYU hospital! (about 1 1/2 miles) We discovered the Glass Garden at Rusk. It was perfect, lots of plants, birds, koi pond, sandbox, play area outside with ride on vehicles. The kids loved it and then they had dinner with their Uncle Andrew in the hospital cafeteria. Many late nights, lots of break in routine, wild tired children, looking to get back to normal (whatever that is!)
The caterpillars arrived in a box yesterday.  Today we began our "caterpillar metamorphosis journal."   Of course, we read "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" (Dancin helped read it!), then we went through the fruit and foods in Spanish.  We also counted them in Spanish.  They picked out a new cereal at the store yesterday (Gorilla Munch), which had all sorts of reading about Diann Fossey and endangered gorillas, etc. We talked about endangered species and organic foods and somehow we ended up looking at the volcano book.  We played the pond game from yesterday which covered the different seasons.  We talked about frog and salamander metamorphosis and read about them in My Big backyard.  Dancin had Trailside camp and the naturalist commented on him knowing his herbivore/carnivore/omnivore!  He was quite proud of himself.  We spent an hour at the museum, mostly in the dark area with the fluorescing minerals.  We came home in the pouring rain to learn about more flooding in the basement!  We then did some M&M math.  Dancin is picking up the addition subtraction pretty quick.  We counted by twos and fives.  We did some graphing also.  Kai wanted in on the action so he did some colors and counting to 5.  Then I asked him how to say "caterpillar" in Spanish and he looked at me curiously and said, "I just learned that!" (don't ask that yet mom!)
We went shopping the other day for school supplies a
