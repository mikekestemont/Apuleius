got some valium down us and went 'kip. A furthur 6 hours later our free tickets gained us entry to the big chill, mushrooms were consumed and history allowed to take its course. The sun shined all weekend, steelez was located despite his best efforts to evade detection and the easy star allstars (over use of the word "star" in a name if you ask me) gave us a fine rendition of dub side of the moon to bring the evening to a close, mmmm. I had to be back at work in nottingham at 10 this morning, hence i feel like shit. over and out
we´ve been on the backpackers road for almost half a day, and already my arse is sweatier than a fat man doing pushups in a sauna.
I like that the house has a profile, and that it has a comedy answer to the random question. Well done that house.
Good luck to you Tommy, may Vishnu guide you to safe lodgings and away from the temptation of those who would wish to take your money and enter your bowels. Keep us abreast of your movements by all means but I suspect that your soon to be all too frequent  bowel  movements can be taken as read. Unless of course you pass something that we all should hear about (and I don't mean elephants in the streets).  Snr Bowen, I understand that you yourself are soon to be going on some adventures of your own. Look forward to some Full Moon madness with you and your lady friends.  Jamie - try and keep Steelez under control whilst the others are away, you know how he likes to take advantage of our kindness. I checked the dates for Freshers' week and driver training starts on the 6th which I believe is a Monday. I'll be back on the Tuesday for that - I've made  special  arrangements with the crew for some personal tuition! Freshers' week starts officially on that Friday but I think all the fun starts the day before when all the youngsters arrive keen as mustard. I'll take 'em down a peg or two.  Amy - download the software from  urlLink www.ephpod.com . Hope you're adjusting to the real world without too much bother!!  Steelez - did you want your Thai wife with or without a penis? I can't remember what you told me.  Twiggy - How was El Grande Chill??  Tom S - Is Kitty behaving herself??  Kitty - Is Tom behaving herself??  I'm off to Bangkok on the morrow. I hope i live...
Ah Tommy, you must remember to take plenty of Lynx and no soap, for that "Indian shower" feel. Gotta get in with local customs eh? Have a tremendulous time in Mmmmmmmmmby and the rest of India. Don't get lost.
