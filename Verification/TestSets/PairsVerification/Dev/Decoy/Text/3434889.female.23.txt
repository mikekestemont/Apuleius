urlLink Im new to all of this  So today is another craploa day to the max times infinty. i am so mad at myself for not going back to work. its like some kind of paralysing fear comes over me and i cant face the idea of getting out of this house to go to work. its like i am afraid to leave the house - yet the money woes are creeping back again. damo is worrying about how we are going to pay our bills - i know i have some sick leave available - but not a lifetimes supply! how do other people get through this darkness ? i have done this before and always come out on top - but it just seems that each time i fall down that mountain again its a little bit harder to claw my way back up. its like i have this negative nagging going on in the back of my mind that wont let me do anything for myself. i walked out the house yesterday and started to cry - it got worse as i drove closer and closer to work. i hate knowing that something like this is happening to me and that i am not in control of anything. i need to get back to work though - its just the mornings are getting so hard. maybe i should do what nicole did last year and start working from 9-6 - i will ask rob today when he calls me - i will tell him the mornings are so hard and i need to  be able to come to work a bit later for a couple of weeks just while i get back in the swing of things. i dont think going part time is the answer. i think that will only create more problems and more time for me to sit around doing nothing wasting away. i need to get out of this house more! i need to join some kind of social club where i can meet people again - i have no-one except for my family, damo and louise and jai - and they are 4 hours away! i need some new people to have as friends - even if they are just people i see when im at this place. what should i do then ? well i was thinking netball would be a good idea - god i just got a bill for the shrink - $200 groan. it is so unreal the way that they charge for just sitting there - he didnt even help me! i got sent to him for no reason at all by my doctor and now he has the gall to ask me for $200. and i love the way that the date of the consult was over a month ago as in they have given you 'time' to pay - now they are demanding it. yet when you go to leave - they are like 'oh thats fine, its all taken care of' making you think y
