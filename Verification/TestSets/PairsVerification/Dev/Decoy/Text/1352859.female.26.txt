Blogs....   A strange phenomenon which has proved to be extremely infectious. Forget about Ebola, Sars or Anthrax. Blogs have become the new threat to life as we know it and is spreading faster than can be imagined, both airborne and by touch and is immensely contagious.  The worst branch of this epidemic seems to be the Xanga-branch. Several people I have observed, who were previously strong and otherwise healthy, have fallen victim to this aggressive virus commonly known as Xanga-blog.  This very destructive mutated form of the blogger virus is claiming several lives every day and the rate seems to be rapidly accelerating.   Other known branches of the virus are Blog-dot and Globe of blogs although these are so rare that only a few cases have been reported so far.  The original form of this virus, known as Blogger, has proved less contagious but in other ways stronger than the mutated branch, Xanga.  Mutual symptoms for all branches are so far known to be an overwhelming urge to rant and tell your most private thoughts and feelings, being in the strong belief that others might actually have an interest in reading them. This is not all, however, as the symptoms will soon escalate into strange behaviour, such as including links in signatures on different forums and discussion groups around the web, in order to spread the virus onto new victims.  Sadly, no cure for this condition has so far been discovered.  A silent enemy that shows no fear and no remorse. The Blog appears to have come to stay!
I need a vacation!   So far this day has been terrible. I went to work and went to shut off the alarm as usual..... and found that I simply couldn't remember the code! *slaps forhead* Come on! Something I've done almost every day for nearly 3 years. Talk about early Alzheimer's! So the alarm went howling, I managed to remember the code and shut the thing off and called in to tell the security guys that I did  not  want to see any of them.  After that, everything went fine.  For about 15 minutes.  Then I just happened to slam into a wall because I (for one reason or another) misjudged the distance. *sigh*  I am the only person I know who can actaully manage to do such things (or at least the only one to openly admit it!)  Maybe I should try to get 4 hours of sleep at night instead of only 3... *rolls eyes*  It's not like there's any wild activity going on anyway to keep me from sleeping... (ah, but if only....*snickers*) Ahem!   Actually, the wall-thing happens ocassionally, so maybe it's time to get those contacts after all.... If only the yellow ones I used when playing live "Vampire; the rpg" hadn't been stolen. They looked pretty cool with my black hair. Hehe! Well....if only my hair was still black! *sigh*  This reddish-blond thing is just so damn boring and doesn't go well with anything. I don't really understand the fascination some people have with it. Maybe I s
