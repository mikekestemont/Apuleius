and I love watching them play from our windows.  Most of the time they run off when I step outside, but once in awhile if I sit on my porch or deck they'll decide I'm not a threat and come back out.  Deer birds and the occasional wild turkey also come to visit, but I'm particularly fond of the rabbits.  They are swift graceful little things.  I love watching them interact with one another.  Their little hops are so childlike and their runs are so determined.  I love how all movement stops and their ears shoot straight up when they pick up an unfamiliar noise.   Yesterday I discovered where at least some of them live.  They seem to have a burrow right next to the driveway.  How is it that their house is so close and I never noticed before?  Rabbits are such clever little creatures.  I'm honored that they chose to live next door.
I came home tonight going, "I think I'd like to eat some tuna." So I made myself some 'tuna salad' where you add the Miracle Whip and the tuna and mix 'er together... yummy. The only thing that was missing were Triscuit crackers. That's a must for a tuna craving. At least in my books, it is.  But this sudden urge for Tuna has got me thinking about cravings. How many times do we succumb to these cravings? For example, along with the tuna, I've been eating processed cheese like it's going out of style. Bizarre because I normally don't eat all that much processed cheese. I'm usually the type that goes out and buys the block of cheddar or edam or gouda and chows down on that. But lately I've been picking about processed cheese slices...  No, I'm not pregnant. Unless, of course, I am experiencing an immaculate conception, and it has recently happened.  What's the deal here? I don't understand this - or is it that I was tuna and processed cheese deprived?  Bah, just me and my ramblings...
Well, here I am at three friends house where two of them are getting married, and I'm taking part in a 'bachelor' party. Yeah, that's right. Me, female, is taking part in a male tradition. I don't know how I  managed to fit in (perhaps I blend into the scenery somehow), but I'm here.  I feel privileged, and weird to be here. I almost feel as if I should be elsewhere.  I'm glad that my two friends are getting married. I've known them for 7 + years, and I was wondering when they would be getting married, particularly when I lost touch with them. But it seems like nothing has changed, and the fact that they are getting married is awesome.  So, about men and their rituals. Thus far, they have played console games, watched people play console games, and drank beer.  It's overrated.
Oh where oh where can he be? ...
