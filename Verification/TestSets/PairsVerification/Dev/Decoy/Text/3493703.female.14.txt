friend if not anything else, because you are indeed a genuine person. How do I know this? It is because of your smile. Never did I see a smile so pure, so genuine and honest. Please live, for your family, for your friends! I am pretty content being your savior here, or so they say, and with this pouring of my feelings to you, I feel as if I have been so blessed already. I should have prepared for this! I would love to cross the street with you again if you know what I mean… I am not expecting anything else, I think holding your hand is already harassment! I am kidding! Anyway you take care, and go do your thing.   Yeah they said she was in a coma so I thought this would be the perfect time to actually say what I want to say. So I did right? Yes and something shocking really happened…  She held back...  It was a gesture of acceptance, of "I hear you." It was like she heard everything I was saying. Nothing else but her hand moving, and I was so happy that she was able to listen to me. I felt that she was on her way to a speedy recovery because she heard me.
