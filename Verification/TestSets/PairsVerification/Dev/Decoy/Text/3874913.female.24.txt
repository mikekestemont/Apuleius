caught off guard. We weren't EXPECTING that person to fall down. It isn't normal. But still, WHY do we laugh?  But still, how are feelings of superiority or release or whatever turned into this weird, uncontrolled act of laughter that your body goes through?  Beats me buddy!  Here's what  urlLink Bill Forsyth , Screenplay writer has to say about this   "I think that Glaswegian humour is very similar to New York humour, which is really Jewish humour for it is the humour of despair, the humour of the gallows. The humour of awful circumstances or predicaments. I think that is where humour comes from. From situations where the only way out is to laugh, for survival's sake. At the bottom of every joke is a piece of despair, you can't produce a laugh without it. If someone falls on a banana skin you get a laugh, but someone gets hurt."  "I think we're basically all odd.  I think we all have a tension between what we think we are and what other people think we are."    I guess that explains it all........Its the subconscious fight between who we are and who we think others think we are!   Yet to see a person who doesnt behave this way.
............for themselves.  Due to Popular demand and my selfishness not to lose my regular readers, here I am again. (Dint know so many people started their day with a dekho at the GWBE corner! What an honour!)  Scarcity of time and one of my mood swings in progress. Dont feel like writing much. Thought I'll make it easier for me and make this a photo blog.  So sit back and enjoy the show.   urlLink    Freshers Party 31 July 2004 We the PGP1 All set at the Freshers Party on Saturday Night at Taj, where the food was worse off than the IIMK mess food but spirits were at an all time high!
