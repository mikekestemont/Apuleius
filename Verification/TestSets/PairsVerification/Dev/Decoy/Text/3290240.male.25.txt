So today I slept and woke up to a hot apartment...I cleaned up the living room and the office...why is it that our partners constantly try to frustrate us....anyways not a lot going on today..OH I got the job and I start on Tuesday...I'm very excited about that....my life is balancing back out like I want and I'm still in the swing of building my craft....other than that....not a lot.....ciao
When one thinks to much about the past, does he think he can alter his present?  Lately I have found myself thinking about the past a lot and wondering what could have been.....pondering the thoughts of what if!        Today I cleaned up the rest of the apt and then just relaxed and cooked myself dinner...Hamburger Helper..hehehe....I'm good at that....then I just relaxed and chatted with friends.  I have a shoot for Nissan Commercial tommorow..just background work again, but hey its experience...so I'm off now...till then I bid thee farewell!
Okay so today begins my new embarkment into life and new embarkment on a place to put all that is in my head.  I do remember that this is an online journal so nothing that will incrimidate me or ruin me in the future.  Anyways, today I was supposed to go do some background work on the set of the remake of "Stepford Wives" with Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Faith Hill, and many other great starts, however, after waking up at four thirty am and getting ready to go, I can't find my keys...well I couldnt leave without my keys so I had to cancel the shoot with me.  HOwever, that is okay because I'm filming a commercial for Nissan, background work as well, you have to pay your dues as an actor to get to the big stuff...unless your lucky and just happen to be at the right place at the right time.  So then Monday I'm possibly filming background work for "Curb your Enthusiasm" not sure yet, but I do start my new job at GREYLINE on Tuesday...I'm psyched about that.  I will get to stay in class and finally make money again and stop stressing, because that is a bitch when you have to worry about this and that.....continueing on with my day I cleaned up the kitchen and organized some things and started my Baked Potatoe a night thing....to add calories.  Not sure what the plan is for tommorow will find out when I wake up tommorow....so n ow I"m just listeining to ENIGMA and enjoying the relaxation mood.  So I guess I will write more in time......
Today was a productive day...work was boring as usual...how many people in the world really love their job..hmmmm...not me...I mean I don't hate it but it does get boring....so moving on....    TOnight Jen and I went to see "Fiddler on the Roof" with ALfred Molina...now I have to admit I was really not caring about goign to see this show, because 1. I heard it sucked and 2.  It bored me when I was a kid to watch it on t
