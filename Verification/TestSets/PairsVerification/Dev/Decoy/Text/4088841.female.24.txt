Being a woman is pretty difficult, I think. I have centuries of stereotypes weighing down on me – preconceived notions that women are emotional and crazy and needy and weak. Being an intelligent woman is even harder, though, because I know that women are emotional and crazy and needy and weak. It’s a daily battle for me to balance my rational thoughts against my God-endowed ability to let emotion rule my every action.  I think in most cases I do a pretty good job. But emotion tends to win over more often than not if alcohol is involved.  Now, because I work at a bar and date a rum enthusiast, the battle is even tougher.  One night Christopher and I walked down the street to a recently opened bar where a friend of his was bartending. This place was not my usual type of hang-out. The featured music was tinny European techno spun by a dj and there was a $7 cover at the door. Not to mention the fact that I was not particularly fond of this female friend of his.  At this point, we hadn’t been dating very long, and, as is my usual rule, I was pretty open about letting him do whatever he wanted and keeping a safe distant from any sort of controlling behavior on my part. The rational side of me likes to just try and have a good time enjoying a new boyfriend’s company as opposed to being all uptight and clingy, at least until the boundaries of the relationship are set. Usually, with luck, I can continue being laid back as the relationship progresses. And I’m normally not a jealous person. I have no problem, for example, that he subscribes to an adult DVD rental program and that I regularly find titles like “Cum Swapping Sluts” in his DVD player. I am not stupid and I realize I am not the first girlfriend he has, so I generally don’t get upset when he mentions previous indiscretions. And most of my close friends are men, so I take it in stride that several of his close friends are women.  So here is how my internal dialogue was going on this particular night:   Emotional me : “I really do not like Christopher’s friend. They seem too close. Plus, she’s very cute and she’s, like, a size 2.”   Rational me : “God, don’t be so insecure. You spend practically every night at his house. Don’t you think you’d know if he was fucking around on you? Besides, even if he wanted to, when would he have the time? He spends all his free time with you, happily.”   Emotional me : “I know, but I don’t trust her. One time, he was wearing this really cool shirt, and when I told him I liked it he said she’d bought it for him. That  bitch .”  This conversation continued as I continued to down Myers’ and cokes. Pretty soon, I was very intoxicated and my rational voice was being drowned out by my emotional voice. I got u
