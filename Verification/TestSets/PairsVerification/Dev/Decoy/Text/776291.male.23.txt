the years that I was the most malleable.  Now, to play Devil’s Advocate, I am not saying that college is just a social zone where you are expected to learn nothing and just meet people.  If you wanted that, just go to a frat party, there will be tons of good people worth meeting there.  (Maybe sarcasm, perhaps not. I will be considered indifferent on this issue.  I don’t really think that frats and sororities are what cause people to act like jerks, bitches, or assholes.  People are the way they are.  It does however seem that traits are magnified sometimes when you join one of those organizations.  I speak from the inside looking out folks.)  Classes do serve a good purpose, to teach you HOW to learn, not what to learn.  I’m taking a course in Dante right now, and I wouldn’t have a damn clue where I would start with the reading of that thing, it’s complex shit. I’m glad I have a teacher that has somewhat of a clue how to steer my understanding of the piece.  Other classes I have taken, like my OPIM 204 class, is a complete waste of my time. It’s a classroom regurgiatation of what I have been learning on the job for the past 5 years.  In a year, I graduate from UConn.  What will I remember?  Will I remember that one course that changed my life? No.  Am I going to care about what I took my fifth semester? No. I can barely remember what I took my fifth semester now!  What I can and will remember is the people that helped change my life. I’m never going to forget the name of the person who got my into the UCMB; I’ll never forget who gave me entry into an organization that did in fact change who I was and magnified my good ideals; and I’m not going to forget that the road to my happiness was paved by going to the mailbox, and reading the letter that said: “You are hereby accepted to the University of Connecticut.”  It should have read: “You’re going to UConn. Be prepared to have your life changed in ways you never would have thought possible.  Imagine that your limits will be tested beyond your wildest imagination.  You are going to meet people in your first days that will still be with you, and will forever be with you through all the ups and downs.  You are going to join organizations.  You will drop out of organizations.  Your loyalties will be concreted. You are going to decide here what you want to do with your life. You are going to try. You are going to fail. You are going to try again.  You will eventually succeed.  You are going to leave this school by graduation or otherwise with a better idea of who you are.”  I have learned about myself.  I have faced my fears, tested my boundaries, and I will never look back.  Burning in flames to be reborn in light…  Peace.  ~ The P
