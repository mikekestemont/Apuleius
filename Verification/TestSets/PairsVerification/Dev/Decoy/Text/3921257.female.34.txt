If always do what you've always done. You will always get what you got. --Nicole
Sometimes life is hard. This is one of those times. Too many road blocks. Although life is hard and life can be conquered now is not the time. How to say goodbye is the hardest thing to figure out.   Many people will be upset.. Will they get over the pain..Will they have pain for a long time…Will they forgive me…I hope so.. It never seems to get easier…What can anyone expect…Life is hard…From abuse to cancer to the end to whatever comes next.  Dark is the tunnel that lies ahead. There is no light. I am afraid of the dark. There are demons in the dark. There are demons that I have never seen. I have heard them and they are not pleasant. Scared to death. If there was only a shimmer of light in the tunnel. But no. No light, no hope, no dreams. So what is point.   There are many thing to stay for…The possibility of getting through this time. But I do not think that will happen. It can’t happen. The memories will always be there. What good does it do to minimize them. If they are there how can they not hurt.  Have I failed this life..Have I failed if I leave now…I don’t think so. I have accomplished much.. I have gotten through many things that most people couldn’t get through. Leaving is not giving up..It is a starting over…A new beginning.  My hope is that all will be forgiven in the next go around. And if there turns out to be nothing past this life then it doesn’t make any difference.   I contemplate why anyone would hurt a child and I have no answers. Why Why Why…As an adult I find there to be much companionship. Is that what the adults want that abuse children. Do they know how much people are willing to help…Ask …Why don’t they ask for help…  So many adults that abuse child have no concept of the life time of pain they are causing to the child. It’s as though it makes no difference. Like the child will not be harmed. It is only love right. I say no it is not love. A simple touch can be harmful. Sometimes more harmful than the worst abuse imaginable. Life is full of horrible ironies.  An adult abuser was probably hurt as a child. So why would they want the same thing for another child. Certainly they remember the pain that was inflicted on them. No matter how great your pain there is no reason to push that onto an unwilling child. Children can be so innocent. Abuse rips the innocence from them. No matter what age. An infant that is abused will know that something happened to them. There is no hiding it. There will always be at least 2 people that know. And even though the abuser moves on the child will always remember. Always.  I don’t get it.&nbsp; Surely my friends can understand. How c
