Yesterday I went to see the much-hyped Mani Ratnam movie " urlLink Yuva " with Kalpana and Asif. Much to my disappointment, the movie did not make an impact and lacked the luster one would have expected from a Mani Ratnam movie.  Yuva is painstakingly slow. It drags. It does not have a firm story line. Hence, one can find the " youth moving into politics trying to clean the scum of the earth " kind of an old tune being played this time though by a much respected and professional producer/director. Somehow from the beginning of the movie I had begun to believe that the movie is going to suck. Who knows, it could have been my dreamy sleepy eyes which wanted the much needed rest after a grueling day at office; that made me want to doze away, forcing me to loose all interest in the flick.    So what?s the story?  All things said and done, Yuva is a drama, a serious movie about three men (Devgan, Bachan, Oberia) who, coincidently fall into each other, having their own story narrated by Ratnam in his own good style. The biggest drag, however, was the climax that was shown four times, over and over again, from each person's perspective.  Devgan is a Student Political Leader, interested in cleaning the scum from the Indian politics by working things out HIS way. Bachan is the corrupt politician?s right hand who is asked to kill Devgan, as the latter?s advances into politics seems to threaten the corrupt politician's fate. Oberia is a person thrown into the plot, a flirt my nature, having a desire to settle in the US of A, saves Devgan when he is shot by Bachan and would become a major fan of what Devgan wants to do, ending up beaten to pulp by Bachan and of course at the end winning the elections along with Devgan. Even A. R. Rahman's music was no music to the ears.  To cut the story short, there is nothing great in this movie, care to ignore it or wait till it comes on Sony/Set MAX/Star, which I fear, is going to be pretty soon.   urlLink Read more

So, it is finally over. After a month long pain of arranging things for our own marriage Kalpana and I are finally glad that everything just went fine. The biggest surprise, however, comes from the fact that even after five days both of us fail to believe that we are finally married to each other and would be living together for the rest of our lives.   Not many relatives from both my father's and mother's side had turned up so it was easy managing the lot. The  Devagon  and  Yagnopavita  where done gracefully and everyone had some good fun too. To my embarrassment, I had to take my shirt off during the thread ceremony (Yagnopavita) a
