blog...this stuff is contagious...one of my friends started doing this about 3 months ago...and now i have it...but onto a blog:  Its around 10 in the morning, im sitting here in my boxers and a tye die T-shirt. My neck hurts like hell and my arm feels dislocated, but i know its not cause i can move it around. The reason my neck hurts is because of a few days ago my friend, Tim, came over for only the 2nd time ever. Because his coming over is such a rarity we party like hell. He puts in a slipknot CD and we wet our hair and start head banging and jumping around and moshing (run around in circles hitting each other). Well...as much of a Kurt Cobain fan and as much as i agree with his ideals.... i like to mosh...especially in large groups. He thought moshing was bad because of how macho and primitive it is. And I hate macho people...Rednecks, jocks, hell...anyone even closely related can kiss my pale white ass. But I do like moshing because its fun, and when music has a good and heavy enough riff, its even more fun. Oh well...morale for today is:  "At least you still have your thumbs and a door on your bathroom"
Fuck everyone who is reading this.    morale for today:  "the world is covered in assholes, and some dont feel like blogging for a while"
Not feeling great, dont feel like making a post...so here we go.
