out of people to talk to. My family dont give a shit, the few people that I might be able to remotely class as friends either dont want to hear it, or just dont need the shit. It is pathetic when you are having a party and the only people you have to invite are family.  Anyway, I still havent figured out what the point of this post is, I guess it is just a way for me to winge. It is also a way to explain to people what my brain is doing.  Well, I think I will leave you on that misereable thought and go back to trying to stay alive   P.S This is also a good time and place to say thank-you to the few people that have stood by me through all my shit...Even if they dont read this, in the case that I do give up one day, I am sure that someone can point them to this post.
Those that know me, will know that I basicly have no friends. There are people who think they are my friend even though they have betrayed me a million times. Others pretend to be my friend because of my family ect. Well the other day, thanks to my prince chatting to people on the net I have a friend. The bad news is, she has come along at a bad time.  You see I am going through a stage where I dont want to leave the house or see people. Now that is fine when you dont have to go anywhere, but when you want to catch up with someone, it makes it very hard. On top of that, when I am like this, i getr paranoid. I keep thinking my prince is going to leave me for her. I know this wont happen, but I sometimes think he would be better off with her.  Ah well, back to trying to find away to hide from the world
On the off chance that there is more than one or two people that read this blog, I have decided to make an annoucment. Anyone that decides that they can judge or punish me for the actions of others, or because of my choice of partner and friends can  GET FUCKED .  I have had enough of all the shit that is being thrown my way due to childishness or small mindedness. I am a person inmy own right and am not a part of others to be judged as they are judged.
Life is a funny thing sometimes. After threatening that I am going to move to qld more times than I can remember, I looks like there is a chance that I might be. After looking for work around here for ages, it looks like  urlLink my prince  might have a welding job.  The problem...It is working in the mines in qld. If I knew more about it I would tell you, but unfortunatly I have told you all the details that I know of.  Stay tuned for more d
