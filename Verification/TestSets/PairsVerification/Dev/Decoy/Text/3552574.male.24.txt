in "Garden State"- Natalie Portman is radiant and Sarsgaard is as laid back and perfect as he usually is. I can't say enough about these two in this movie.   5.) Running- I never thought I'd say it, but I kind of look forward to a little job when I get home from work now and then. Slip on the headphones and move my legs until want to pass out.    Bonus Person in Heaven This Week:   Dave Chappelle -this motherfucker just got a $50,000,000 contract to make a whopping 20 Episodes in 2 years. $2.5 Million an Episode. $113636.36363636363636363636363636 per Minute. "I'm rich, Biatch!" indeed.
I knew HBO was smart.  I didn't think they were going to pick a stinker in this Entourage business.  Larry Charles shows up to write tonight's third episode and the show almost instantly became fun, sexy, dirty, and maybe even smart.  Instead of being a Sex and the City with guys, it is this weird Seinfeld spawn.  I hope it continues in this direction with more established talent writing the show and less of whoever wrote those first two episodes.  Ben, Tim, you can recommence watching the show.  Catch it this week on reruns.  You'll enjoy it a lot more than the last two (i know that isn't saying much, but give it a shot).
This afternoon I took the opportunity to catch Zach Braff's "Garden State".  I had some trepidation about checking out the flick.  1.  it is written, directed, and starring a tv actor from a mildly funny sitcom which made it seem to be like, "boy, i'm mildly famous, i can make a movie with my actor buddies".  2.  it seemed like it was going to be melodramatic and at the same time have this quirkiness to it to make it "hip".   Both of my early assesments were completely wrong.  The flick is a little gem.  By no means perfect and I still have a problem with Braff starring in the film, but it has a great cast (the nearly always perfect Peter Sarsgaard and a really radiant Natalie Portman stepping it up a notch.  It is strange too because it seems like Portman's character is the older version of several of her old roles combined).  I would check it out if you have an afternoon to spare and want to just go see a good little movie.
urlLink    I can across this just now and I wanted to share.   urlLink http://www.melaniegriffith.com/in2mec/index.html   I think she got it wrong, should be In To Me, See?  Give it a Edward G. Robinson reading when saying it outloud.
urlLink    As i am watching the cubs game on wgn, this commerical comes on that is reminiscent of these new stroke commercials, where this woman comes on and says shes a burden.  so this one is of a dude who sounds like said stroke victim, except they cut to him licking his wife's handheld mixer when it turns on and his tongue gets stuck.  hilarious.  cut to dq showing what the brownie batter blizzard loks like and i think i fell in l
