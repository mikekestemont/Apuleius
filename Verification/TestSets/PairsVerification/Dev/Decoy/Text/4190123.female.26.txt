Princess Diana's anniversary will be in a few days time.  August has always been a very trying month for me. This is the month where I am reminded of the whole Life & Death issue - a few of you already know why.  On August 23rd 1997 I lost a friend in an auto wreck. She wasn't speeding, drunk, high or careless. She hit some roadwork equipment that had been accidentally left in an awkward position and lost control of her car. The end.  Or so I thought.  Steph was my partner in kitchen. Because the kitchen environment functions heavily on a "buddy"system, your partner is someone that you rely on. A lot! There's a bond between you that very few people outside will ever be able to relate to.  The cuts, the scrapes, the aching backs, the broken plates, the sore feet, the oven burns, the fights, the yelling matches, the teamwork, the severe pressure, the chilling out over a beer after work, the knowledge that someone's watching out for you 150%. It was all a fantastic blend of what I thought I wanted out of life.  I felt young and confident. I was good at something and I knew it.

The week before Steph had said that I could take over some of her duties for a change and I was looking foward to them.  Got into the briefing room, everyone's in tears, even the boys, Chef looks pale, pulls me over to him, gives me a squeeze, "I'm so sorry mate", I spend a mandatory amount of time with the rest of the team before stumbling home in a state of shock.  And thats all I remember clearly. Everything else from that point until her funeral has kind of faded from memory.  But I do know that Steph's funeral service was on the same day that Diana died.  Nothing was ever the same for me again. Cheffing wasn't fun anymore. It was WORK! It was irritating and aggrivating. I was losing my temper often. Also, nothing seemed to mesh anymore. I was making constant mistakes. I got a huge amount of support from everybody and they really tried their best to make me feel at home again. But this thing that I loved doing so much was turning it's back on me and I couldn't stop it.  I also started getting very paranoid around m
