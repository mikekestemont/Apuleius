sorry i didnt write yesterday.. was too hurt tht i cld not even expressed my feeligs into words.. wat happened yesterday was one of d best things he as ever done to me.. n it seems tht he enjoys doin it.. well yeah, its always my fault.. n mayb i deserve tht frm him for bein who i am.. im jealous of dilys..? where did he ever get such idedas..? i reali dunno wat is on his mind.. neither do i noe wat izit tht he wants.. everythin i do now dun seem to please him at all.. mayb its a blessing.. mayb he wld come to realise tht im not worthy of his love n wld start hatin me..n wen sch starts, he'll get to noe more girls, get close to dem n thts it.. yani wld juz be a memory to him.. oh well.. but wat abt me..? i dunno.. as much as i want to make him happy, i cant.. y..? cos as much as i want to be wif him, i cant.. theres juz somethin inside which tells me tht things wld not wrk out well bet us if we were to get into a relationship deeper den friendship.. i dun wanna lose him.. wat if we go into a relationship now.. n he finds someone new at campus..? not tht i dun trust him.. but his campus is like so freakin big n there'll be like thousands of other girls.. i mean, we still hv a long way to go.. but does anybody care or understand..? NO..! n now he even  thinks tht im askin him to find another girl. wat the fuck. i mean, like i said.. i noe tht we cant be together, for now, tht is.. but i cant let him hold on to me for d rest of his life rite.. i dun wanna be selfish.. i juz want him to hv d freedom of u noe.. gettin close to a girl n stuff like tht.. he juz doesnt noe all these.. n nvr cared to noe.. i can go on writing for hrs.. but d things he said yesterday, hurts.. alot.. so much tht til now, i cant seem to reali express it all in words.. he used to be d person who wld noe how i feel.. but now, i dun even dare to tell him.. i dun wanna go tru wat i went tru yesterday.. it reali hurts.. esp when it all comes frm HIM.. dunno wat he thinks of me now.. but i think its better if i dunno anythin rather den gettin to noe somethin, onli to end up gettin hurt.. mayb its some kind of a retribution for all d things tht i did in d past.. for breakin d hearts of people.. esp guys.. oh well...
