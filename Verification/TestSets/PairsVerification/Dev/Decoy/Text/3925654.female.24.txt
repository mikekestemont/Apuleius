Well I'm back east for the next month or so.&nbsp; My plans include relaxing, sleeping, cooking, running, and practicing French.&nbsp; The first two I should have no trouble with, the third I'll do at least 3 or 4 times, and the last two might require a bit more self-discipline.&nbsp; But above all, I'll be savoring hills, seafood, and the knowledge that I am teetering on the edge of a continent instead of lodged firmly in the middle.&nbsp;
Well, somewhere along the way, I became a Cubs fan.&nbsp; There I was last night, in one of Alex's tee-shirts, on my feet, yelling and clapping along with most of the rest of the crowd at "Wrigley North" (a.k.a. Miller Park) as the Cubs pulled ahead in the eighth last night.&nbsp;   Last night's game lacked the&nbsp;fireworks of the prior week's game, but boy do they put on a show in Milwaukee.&nbsp; I guess I was supposed to be most thrilled by the great sausage race, which is the Brewers' version of the Yankees' subway race, except in Milwaukee people dressed in huge tube-like costumes that only vaguely resemble a hot dog or bratwurst race down the third base line.&nbsp; The "Polish" won, which didn't seem to surprise anyone, I guess because he has the best record this reason.&nbsp; These mid-westerners sure take their sausage seriously.   Anyway,&nbsp;what struck me as the&nbsp;biggest differences between Miller Park and Wrigley were the loud, in-your-face music blasted between every batter and the enormous jumbotron up above the outfield.&nbsp; I'd put Yankee Stadium somewhere in the middle, not quite as old-fashioned and strictly authentic as Wrigley but not as brash and brassy as Miller Park.&nbsp; I must admit that it is nice to be able to watch the replay of any close call&nbsp;in near life-size right after the play.&nbsp;   The Cubs&nbsp;may still be ten games behind St. Louis, but they're only two games out of the Wild Card spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; And tonight they're leading Milwaukee 2-0 at the top of the first...
I've resisted posting recipes so far because this is really supposed to be a weblog filled with interesting stories about my life and not one of helpful household hints.&nbsp; But I've been&nbsp;puttering around doing decidely uninteresting things aside from cooking, so this is what you get.   Today for lunch I decided to toss some ingredients together and hope for the best.&nbsp; Often, putting random foods together that I like doesn't seem to result in the delicious concoction I hope it will.&nbsp; In many cases, the whole is much LESS than the sum of its parts.&nbsp; However, today's lunch was an exception.   Without further ado...   Chicken, Zucchini, and Fennel&nbsp;a la Hoisin   For the chicken:  1 boneless skinless chicken breast  1/2 zucchini, sliced into thin rounds  1/2 small fennel bulb, sliced thinly  1 small piece of ginger  1 T sesame seeds  cooking spray   Heat a frying pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.&nbsp; Throw in the chicken, zucchini, fennel, and ginger and cook at least until the chicken is cooked through or as long as you want to get everything n
