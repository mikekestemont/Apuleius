\.Listening to "O Praise Him (All This For A King)" by The David Crowder Band  //It has been nearly a week since i last posted. I am getting to where i hardly remember anything now, and that is one of the reasons i began this blog. Wednesday is the earliest i remember. I went to Mary Grace's house that day and went to her youth group that night. I enjoyed it a lot. Their Church is so much larger than mine, and they have a whole lot more youth. They all went out to eat at San Jose's that night.   //I do remember what i did on Thursday, or at least i think it was. I woke up about 1:30 and got dressed and went to town. My SUV had been expired for over a month and i had free inspections for as long as i own my vehicle and free oil changes. That saves a lot of money. After getting that done I went to the mall and got a few things then rushed home. Mary and I cooked Scurby (my step-dad) some speghetti, a cake, and made some sweet, Iced Tea. It was great.   //Friday was awesome. I woke up around 1:45 and had to be at church at 3:45. We were departing at 4 and were on our way to see Michael W. Smith, Mercyme, and The David Crowder Band. The drive was like 2 hours and the van was packed. My favorite show was the opening band, the DCB. Awesome stuff. Too bad I could hardly see them. We had lawn tickets. For those not familiar with the Alltel Pavillion at Walnut Creek, lawn seats at FAR away, and we sat at the back of everyone in the lawn. To sum that up, they all looked like ants on stage. The projector screens kicked in around dusk, and we could make out what shape their faces were. Michael W. Smith and his band put out a nice worship experience. Im glad that I was able to go. We pulled in the parking lot at the church around 2:30.  //Today I mostly sat around the house. I am so dissapointed in myself. I dont think i have done anything physical today. Im debating with myself on whether i should play football or not. Im already kinda late because i havent been lifting any this summer, and ive told everyone that i would not play. Whether i play or not, Monday i am making a pact with myself to get back in shape because this body is doing nothing and is being drowned with Sun Drops.   //Tommorow is Sunday, and when it is Sunday, it is time to go to church. Waking up early for the first time in a week. AHH. Night yall.
\.Listening to "Simple Man" by  urlLink Shinedown   //My weekend has been so long and boring. Thank God it has finally ended. I woke up Saturday morning like 4 hours before i normally do. It was around 8:30 or somethin like that. Then we left my h
