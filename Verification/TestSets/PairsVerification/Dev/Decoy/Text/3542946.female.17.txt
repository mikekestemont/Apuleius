Underground sources have recently reported to me of year 8 parties at uni high with young girls getting wasted and stoned with the alchohol and marijuana being supplied by dodgy year 11's with unknown motives. More info to come.
Am happy to report that there were no major acts of discrimination at Pablo's party. If anyone disagrees say so. The usual women against me discrimination continued one older woman saying she prefeered a 13 yr old named jethro to me. Nothing else too blatant or egregious to report though.  Shalom,  Max K
news from the underground, missed out on Zoi's party last night. didnt score an invite possibly because am jewish. Neil didn't get an invite either. Coincidence? Zoi also has short hair. She will be placed under watch by the m3r for more possible acts of discrimination. Going to Pablo's party tonight. Will report on any descrimination that takes place there.  Most likely descrimination: women against me  Peace out

m3r's Neal Pearlman has gone back to Iowa. He has promised to keep on posting and talking from there but it's still sad to see him go. He is an intelligent, perceptive and fundamentally decent person. During all the time I knew him he was open-minded and didn't let differences of opinion turn into personal dislike, unlike many people all over the world with passionate beliefs.  His time in Australia changed the way many of us thought about America and I think we have changed him as well.  As Neal said, the reason for so many global problems right now is fundamentalism of any sort, where people close their minds and resort to violence. The fact that Neal was able to reflect about his own beliefs makes me respect and admire him as much as anyone I know. He was a funny guy, a good friend to all of us, and could maintain an argument when drunk (Unlike Max, who tried to justify the Vietnam War).  I hope he enjoyed his send-off at Phillip Island, and that life treats him well back in the heartland of America.  Admin.
