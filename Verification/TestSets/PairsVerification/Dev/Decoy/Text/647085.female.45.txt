go.  Instead they take a light load, and many of them work 20, 30 or 40 or more hours helping their families.    Now for any of you who are saying "Kids aren't allowed to work that many hours," I have to point you to the laws about family businesses and farms, and the stats on black market labor -- it's not just for unregistered aliens anymore...  Kids who can, in this economy, are working under the table.  They are working long hours for their family's business without any compensation.  They are working and reporting LEGAL hours, and working unpaid overtime to keep their jobs.  A lot of these same kids are smart and obviously disciplined workers, but know they can't hope to pay tuition because all their labor is required to help their families, or maybe get them to a position where they can support their own new or upcoming family.  Service for college is the answer to build a modern workforce for the US, and the conservatives need to get off their butts and into the schools in poor and blue-collar neighborhoods and start doing some damn mentorship programs if they want better prep for college from our "hoi polloi."
I love  urlLink this retort  of Kristoff's  urlLink Bush-isn't-quite-a-liar apology  in the NYTimes.
In an article entitled  urlLink Nader: White House is Israel's puppet  in the Jerusalem Post, today, we learn:   Nader spoke Tuesday in Washington at the release of a survey of American Muslim voter opinion, commissioned by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The survey of 1,161 voters this month showed that the majority of voters, 56 percent, supported the presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry, and 26% favored Nader, more than five times the percentage Nader has received in nationwide and statewide polls.  Strikingly, only 2% said they would vote for President George W. Bush, even though 55% of those polled said they had cast their vote for him in 2000. Fourteen percent remained undecided. CAIR said it had no estimate of the number of Muslim voters nationwide.

On  urlLink CBS News , Republican Senator John McCain calls an ad criticizing John Kerry's military service "dishonest and dishonorable" and urges the White House to condemn it.   "I can't believe the president would pull such a cheap stunt," says McCain.  One of the veterans says in the ad "When the chips were down, you could not count on John Kerry," but in fact none of the veterans who appear in the commercial actually served with Kerry.  Of the six men who did serve with Kerry, five support his candidacy and one is deceased.  McCain also said the ad "was the same kind of deal that was pulled on me," referring to a rumor campaign against McCain sponsored by Bush supporters during the 2000 presidential primaries.
