(don't get me wrong--i am not complaining about dim sum!!!)  so we tripped around macau all day--stuffed ourselves silly at fernando's and snuggled back up on the turbo jet for our ride home. it rained most of the day, with me hiding under an umbrella (see goodmorning wan chai) which prompted me to make an appointment to get my hair straightend as soon as esprit hair salon opened on monday morning!
so, we are in page one last night--an art/desgin/architecture bookstore that is really, just quite too much! garth and i became a bit overwhelmed by the glutton factor of too many books, too little time. we had agreed on a purchase of rem koolhaas-- s.m.l.xl but had too many parcels to carry on the train..so next time. we won't have to plot to steal tony's now!  so anyways...we are in page one and keane begins to play--highly reccomended if you like verve, oasis, etc. etc.   keanemusic.com/  the world has shrunk and is now available in hong kong also! keane who made their debut on morning becomes eclectic back in october has now creeped into my world and my new favorite book store.  i have also started a fotolog page:  http://www.fotolog.net/ardenwoods/  it will be a photo diary of our travels in asia...nothing too earthshattering yet...just a few pix snapped.
a drizzly sunny humid morning awaits me on the street. my main concern today is finding a flat iron. either that or finding someone to straighten my hair! this could be maddening for a girl who never made peace with her curly hair.   in true nysha fashion, i have our door-man "steve" on the hunt for favorable locations to find this contraption that will keep my hair straight and flat! i did an experiment yesterday with my old blow dryer and it blew up promptly--had the adaptor but not the converter. key is the converter! i guess i missed that lesson in 10th grade science about wattage and electricity and well--it is just different in different places.   maybe i should just get a perm and really curl my whole head out--none of this half curl half frizz thing...just a big bozo the clown head of red-hair. lovely.
i have arrived safe in the wonderful city of hong kong. the cicadas have also arrived from their 17 year slumber. the mountain behind my house is humming with activity.
