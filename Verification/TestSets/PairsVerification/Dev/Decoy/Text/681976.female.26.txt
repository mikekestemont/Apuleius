how many he passed.)  we would laugh when it was over about this massive bridge (later identified as the harbour bridge) around mile 11 that seemingly stretched on forever.  we were both of us alone at this leg of the race and not giving up half way on the uphill was a huge mental challenge!  we both got over it (pat, pat on our backs) and were rewarded pleasantly with a downhill incline towards the finish line!  last time, i was horribly disappointed when i received my finish line photo to see what demented look i had and hopefuly this time will be better since i was wearing a more streamlined shirt, let my hair down so only two ponytails on the side remained, and was waving and smiling to w (who finished earlier) just before the cameras.  :)  my final time:  2:02:19.2 , an unexpected improvement of  9 minutes  from the  urlLink last time .  w's final time was  1:57:41.7  and i'm immensely proud of him for completing it under 2 hours.  (that's my next goal.)   the wind-down   food was aplenty at the finish line: pizza (vito's did well), fruit, juice boxes, water, gatorade, cookies, chips, etc.  funny - as soon as we stopped the pain set in.  muscular and joint pains through w's leg's and sore-as-hell ankles reduced me to hobbling status.  you know what that means....?  another dip in the whirlpool.  squeezed too many bubbles in it was quite amazing.  too bad for the noon check-out time.  :(  we stopped again in moncton to pick up churchill (i have never seen him so excited to see us, he was practically beserk.) and further unwind like vegetables on the lazy-boy sofa.  i got a driving tour of moncton (pretty and distinctly more quiet than halifax) and we head back home....  it was a wonderful experience.  not just the run that was  sooo  satisfying and not just the awesome hotel suite but the little things like trying to navigate ourselves out of that little city and coffee stop halfway between the equator and the north pole (stewiacke) because w fondly remembers mastodon ridge and scooping bubbles out of the tub and trying to neatly feed churchill a sugar timbit and sharing a lot of  "firsts"  and an otherwise unforgettable experience.

i was so excited for this week to come along (post-defense and all) but it's going to be pretty bad.  we have  relatives  visiting starting today, which means re-exploring halifax haunts and a  trip to p.e.i. .  (at least there will be pictures!)  that means i'm out of the office until sometime next week.  this weekend is  urlLink marathon weekend  in saint john.  downside: oh boy, i'm  sooo  ill-prepared this time.  upside: another getaway that i have been looking forward to for  months .  housing issues are plaguing me and so are other weighty matters....  :(   oh, and i can't seem to get rid of that  read more...  option without getting rid of all of them.  so i'm going to end this post to curb the complaining.
