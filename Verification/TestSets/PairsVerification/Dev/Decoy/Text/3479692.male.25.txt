urlLink Showtime - Movies - Opposite Sex, The: Rene's Story - Main   I'm up late again all excited about this blogging.  Sure I'd heard about blogs some time ago, but it never really interested me - why would I want to publish my thoughts for everyone to see?!  First all of the technical aspects interested me - I can list my blog on other sites, provide a feed, host it on my own server, etc.  Then I was at  urlLink Vera's  with Chris tonight telling him about it and he came up with the idea of creating a community out of it.  Wowzers - that's perfect!  Especially since I named it www.andiamsomebody.com...  Well, maybe I should explain the name.  When I checked myself into  urlLink treatment  at 9:00pm on Feb 13, 2004 (the day before Valentine's day on Friday the 13th of all days!), I went to my first meeting.  It was the  Reflections Meeting .  It's a group-run check-in meeting.  There's a structure to it, some traditions like  Positive Strokes  and  Fuzzy Wuzzy , and then you end with checking in and reciting at least three affirmations.  The affirmations are repeated by the group after you state them, and then you end with, "And I  am  somebody," to which the group responds, "and you  are  somebody.    Anyhow, this was my first group meeting and it still hadn't sunk in that I was in  treatment!   ... and here we were saying silly things like, "and I  am  somebody."  It stuck, and thus the site is born some three and a half months (of sobriety) later.    We'll see if the community evolves, but for now it's just me.    Back to my topic.  I was up watching a Showtime original film -  urlLink  The Opposite of Sex  .  It's a documentary made about a woman who undergoes testosterone therapy and eventually surgery to become a man.  The story itself was good and I'm glad I watched it.  In fact, I was in treatment with a M to F transexual and it was a good experience for me to be exposed to - I didn't realize some of the harsh realities these people have to deal with.    Rene, the subject of the film, constantly worked out - he wanted to become a male stripper when the surgery was complete.  They showed his tryouts and it hapenned to be at Club 7969 - at (wouldn't you know) 7969 Santa Monica Blvd.  It struck a chord with me because when I lived in LA a couple years back I actually helped out at that club with some friends who were throwing a weekly themed gay night.  It was pretty sucessful and I always had fun.  Being that I was 'with the DJ,' I usually got free drinks and always took full advantage of the perk.  Funny enough, I had seen the club on an episode of  urlLink Anna Nicole  about a year ago, too.  Johnny Trendy was MCing a drag queen Anna look-alike contest at the club.    Good gawd did I drink in LA.  I w
