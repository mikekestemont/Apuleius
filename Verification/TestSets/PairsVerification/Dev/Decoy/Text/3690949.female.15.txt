Yay!!  I have my new Gmail account...no more hotmail.  So email me there, should anyone actually read this.   Music on the iPod: Guster: "Amsterdam" Joe Henry: "Monkey"
Music on the crappy Radio Station from NYC:  James "Laid" Hilary Duff "Come Clean" Some Metalica crap and other total crap rock/rap bands... (I really miss L.A. radio stations!!)  Had a long talk with my new guardians.  it seems they are concerned; waiting for me to have some sort of meltdown.  i now picture them looking at the ceiling beneith my room, waiting for the slag to fall through.  but what do I tell them?  of course im not particularly happy at present.  who would be?  just burried mom, dad lost it in the process, and im living across the country trying to build a new life.  i'll get it, but give me some slack!  yes, they are wonderfully caring people (they are my god parents after all), but i don't know what they want to hear.  it's as though they want me to just loose it all of a sudden.  but i cant seem to communicate to them that I am just trying to move forward.....
Music on the iPod:  Guster: "Amsterdam"  Franz Ferdinand:  "Cheating on You" Longwave: "Everywhere You Turn" Cowboy Junkies: "My Wild Child"  -no reasons today for why these particular songs nor what they've meant in the past....

Music on the iPod:  Pete Yorn: "On Your Side"     (the guitars..) Beck: "Lost Cause"     (just a great tune - i keep this one just for me) Casey Chambers: "The Captain"  (memories of beach parties) Enya: Random Enya songs that help chill me out  So i've got kind of a cool room.  they have put me at the far end of the "L" shaped monstronsity that is their home.  i've got a balcony which is by far the best part.  there is something about being ouside on a beautiful night when no one is around. there is a gentle breeze, and it is just cool enough to make me put on a sweatshirt over my tank top.  and i just sit there, listening to music, not listening; not really thinking (a welcomed change), just being, feeling t
