from his home forever. God left a mark on Cain's forehead so that every living thing would know what he'd done. Cain made a family in the land named Nod, which meant "Wandering".      Moses:  When Moses saw the Hebrew people worshipping Bel, Moses broke the Ten Commandments because he was infuriated by their wicked deed of idolatry (worshipping another God). Moses' chastisement for breaking the first laws of God given to Hebrews was he would pass away before they reached the Promised Land (The Land of Milk and Honey).    Also remember, it is God that helps give you control, not yourself!
Whenever I feel like there's no hope; like there's no end to all the miseries and pains of this world, I turn to the Lord with the thoughts of His return. Today, I've came across what St. Paul had wrote in Thessalonians 2, about problems that might be testing your faith-   All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed.    2 Thessalonians 1:5-10   So don't fret about this world, but do keep in mind of the Lord's Returning... For He come like "a thief in the night". And only those who will meet the Lord are those who look for Him. So, be forever mindful of him and know this- Don't put this aside ever, for the Lord will come when you least expect it.
Hello, this is my first post. Let me introduce this blog and of myself. First, myself- My Name is Tiffany B. (I usually don't give my last name). I am a teenager and a Christian...or more precisely a Catholic. All I can really say is that I'm a normal everyday person. Well, at least I think I am or I'd like to think that. J/K. =P Anyway, I will write in this blog whenever I feel there is a need to. I'll have to say that I've had blog's before and I never seem to really use them. Also, I must say that I probably won't be writing in this blog after a couple of years. I'll be busy in my studies of wanting to become a nun, evangelist, or a missionary; which of them I don't know what I should choose of. So, with out further a due... Here's my blog with my inner thoughts and such! ^
