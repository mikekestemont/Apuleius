why things have only been temporal and not permanent.&nbsp; i mean sunday night i was&nbsp;stricken thinking&nbsp;i&nbsp;never even got saved.&nbsp; so.&nbsp; i'm trying to figure out how to work all that out.&nbsp; i either need to get on some meds and stop the bad days where i think i haven't changed, or if it's in fact true i haven't changed, then i need to.&nbsp; because i want to be at the place where i think i'm recovered and healed anew, but only if it's legitimate, right now it feels like it's all been a big sham and pretending :(&nbsp;&nbsp; i liked it a lot better when i was able to switch personalities, these days the ups and downs and everything that's wrong is painfully apparent.
here is the thing, i am absolutely l-o-v-i-n-g nick.&nbsp; and i still haven't made up my mind whether or not i want to!&nbsp; i mean things *seem* halfway decent between us these days and it could potentially be progressing, but I don't know if i want it to!!
see, here's the thing...    i wrote nick an email oh about a month ago... *checks email*... 6/25 to be exact.&nbsp; it was a friday, and the thing was we had been edging into some stuff i didn't really want to get into, and i threw myself out there in a vulnerable (for me) way and told him i didn't want to&nbsp;continue and touched on some reasons why not.&nbsp; now to me, the things that i said would definitely either drive someone further or closer, but not indifferent..&nbsp; so i emailed him late one night, had butterflies even sending the darn thing, and then i went to sleep.&nbsp; i didn't think he'd write me back that night, but the next morning i checked it 'just in case'.&nbsp; and then i figured after lunch i'd check it again, thinking he'd have gotten it when he woke up.&nbsp; no answer.&nbsp; so i thought ok, maybe around dinner time i'll check it again.&nbsp; and so on and so on.&nbsp; i swear i checked that gosh darn thing about 15 times that weekend, each time anxiously waiting to see if i had new mail from him, and each time i think i went one inch more towards the&nbsp;crazy side.&nbsp; anywho, needless to say he never gave me the courtesy of a response, and when i talked to him monday i asked (as nonchalantly as i could) if he'd gotten it.&nbsp; yup but he didn't get a chance to reply yet.&nbsp; and apparently over the last month he still hasn't found time to reply yet.&nbsp; he says he's trying to form the words, say things right, that's the way he is, but SHIT!!!!!!!!
well.  i have lots of updates to put in here, but work has been so crazy that i can't upload them or anything.  soon.. :) but hey guess what, i'm supposed to get baptized tomorrow night, this is attempt number 2,346 it seems.  i really wish nick could go, i wish i could even ask him, but he's probly busy anyways.  ah well.
Hi :)   &
