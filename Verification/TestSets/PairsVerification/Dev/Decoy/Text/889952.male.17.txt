"I'm so glad I'm getting my bake on." - The almighty Chaz  I'll tell ya one thing, driving around beachside yelling crazy shit at random people walking down the road never gets old. Just now I was goin down A1A, screaming "Nigger!" at white people. It's funny calling a white person a nigger because they don't know how to react. They're thinking "What? I'm not black..." and I can see a confused look on their face as I look at them through my rearview mirror. It's funny as shit.  Oh yeah, and the obligatory April Fools joke is this --  Me: Hey John, I found out your mom is a lesbian last night. Her girlfriend told me. John: No way man... what the fuck? Me: Yeah dude, your mom's a bulldike. John: That's so gay. Me: I know... literally. Hahahaha I crack myself up. John: But you're serious about this? Me: NOPE! APRIL FOOLS MOTHERFUCKER!!!
