urlLink  > i want the world to fall asleep    for a few seconds today, it felt like autumn in new england. a cool breeze sprung up from nowhere as i walked on a deserted street in oakland, and it set some fallen leaves in motion. i was instantly reminded of the fall weather from my childhood, and the memory made me pause, breathless. the moment lasted for only a few seconds, and then the breeze subsided and the leaves scuttled around and finally lay still. the warmth of the day returned, and i knew once again that i was in california.  even after four years, california seems foreign to me. in new england, the cyclical nature of the seasons affected my mood greatly. the cycle became part of me, and vice versa--although i mostly took it for granted. i assumed that it was simply the way nature worked. i was right, too, but nature only works that way in new england. in california, the weather remains relatively constant throughout the year. the long, dry northern california summers are briefly punctuated by a month and a half of rain, and then the pattern repeats. these are the two california seasons--dry and wet. people will still play frisbee outside (in shorts!) in december here, when the sun breaks through the clouds and the temperature rises again from 50 to 70 degrees. in essence, nothing changes here... nature lies still, warm and stagnant, unaffected by time.  i think this weather affects me adversely. i can see how days stretch into weeks which stretch into months after months, with little to distinguish any one time from another. the first week of fall semester feels much like the last, and hence it easily becomes blurred in my memory, and leaves me feeling disconnected with even the most recent past.  in new england, on the other hand, you learn to feel the seasons change. as fall begins, the trees change color and lush green forests turn bright red and orange. as the temperature drops, the leaves fall and cover the ground. the air becomes crisper, and the earth, grass and trees all grow hard. the nights are particularly invigorating and feel almost electrically charged. most noticable, though, is the noise. as creatures (both human and otherwise) begin to spend more time inside their homes than out, a great quiet descends on the world. the cold air seems to carry any sound far, but there is usually nothing to carry. the result is that you become acutely aware of your surroundings--your senses honed--and you feel very alive, but equally alone. the damping of noise is even greater in the winter, when snow smothers the landscape. at night, in the snow, it is easy to think that you've been trapped inside a snow globe, for the ground is bright white, the s
