dudes predict that he will strengthen into a Cat. 1 storm. I hope everyone has their bottled water / batteries ready on the coast of North Carolina. I'm not sure why I am so attracted to the weather, I think I should have been a meterologist (or learn how to spell). I should go back to school, how much money do they make????
