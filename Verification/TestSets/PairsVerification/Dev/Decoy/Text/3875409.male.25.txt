i bought this damn gameboy advance sp, because i really wanted it to play the classic nintentdo games that i already have for the nintendo that's hooked up to my media center... and the chick who sold it to me (who also need me to do her...) forced me into buying the legend of zelda: a link to the past. more like a link to the crack, damn i should leave a mushroom print on her because i can't put this damn thing down. i've known drug addicts that were less dependent. but now i've come to a problem. i can't fucking beat this one damn level. well, not level, but task, whatever. i need to find out where the really big key is so i can get that item for the elderly man in the village.... WTF... i don't even think that's descriptive enough. anybody out there know what i'm talking about??? i like this game but if i keep dying trying to find this damn key, i'm going to burn the cartridge in a cartridge burning ceremony.  last night we went to see Anchorman... hot DAMN that's a good movie. i mean, the creative genius. how can they come up with this stuff????

You're an employee, you have a supervisor. supervisor, you have a manager. manager you have a vice president. vice president, you have a ceo. ceo, you have a client. client, you have your own boss at your own place of business. it's the gigantic american boss cycle. checks and balances to the point where no one's truly the leader. even the president has to listen to the public, or he (hopefully) gets voted out in november.  now, we all catch these bosses in the act, and don't say anything about it. you see them picking their nose, and eating their boogers. you see them with the toilet paper trailing on their shoes, and you let it slip by you because you don't want to say anything and feel like an ass. well, for a long time, i've been catching my boss in the act. he dances. he dances in the bathroom. everytime i go in there, there he is, singing, dancing, playing waste-paper basketball. living it up in the can while i'm in the cubicle dying of starvation a
