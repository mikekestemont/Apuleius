and went to the bathroom. Then this guy he brought with him (the weird one) started talking to me at the table. He then said "I want to see you... Tomorrow night out front of the building 6:30". Um, yea ok there buddy, I thought. I was not attracted to this guy at all. I couldn't believe it. He is supposed to be one of D's best friends, doesn't know me from adam, and he wants to talk to me. Whatever, he's drunk, I thought. He'll forget about it, and I will too... I just took into consideration that the guy was loaded.  Next day, he comes over. Sober! Whispers to me "Silver Store at 8, don't wanna take a chance being meeting you out front of the building" Fuck! I thought. He remembered. So, not wanting to be mean, I showed up. Met up with my father too. And Deb. So, I told him I had to go for a beer with dad, and I would be back at the Silver at 830. And I was. So was he. We went down to the lake, and he took my hand and all he wanted was to just get to know me. And why I said what I said about D beating me up. So, we talked blah blah blah. Then we sat on a bench at the lakefront, and he started literally begging me to kiss him. I thought "Uh, no!" This guy was sooooooo not my type. I told him we could only be friends, no more no less. So, he told me to kiss him anyways and see if I felt anything lol. Unbelievable. So, whatever. I did, and I pulled away. I didn't feel anything. So, lol, he said "Try again". Still didn't feel nothing, so I suggested we go home. I promised myself forever that I wouldn't get involved in a situation like this, especially some guy that lives in my building. This is why I never did with M next door. Went home, called it a night, whatever... But then I kept thinking about him... and thinking and thinking, in fact, I couldn't stop! It was crazy. I wanted to see him again. When he hugged me, I felt warm, loved and safe, it was weird. See, when I parted with him that night, he asked me to meet him again the next night. I had no intentions. But I couldn't stop thinking about him for some really weird reason. I dunno. So, I kept on meeting up with him through the week. Just to talk and stuff. His kiss was soft and warm. We learned a bit here and there about eachother. He's&nbsp;a total romantic. He's an amazing person. True. Real. Everything. So far anyway. He started working last week, so he asked if he could get my cell number in case he works late, he wants to call me and say goodnight. He told me he can't stop thinking about me. He said a lot to me. I'll continue tomorrow, I'm getting t
