All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere And their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tommorow, no tommorow And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you 'Cos I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very Mad World  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me, no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson Look right through me, look right through me  Mad World.

now i wonder,  if i disapeared again would anyone notice? now i wonder,  am i alone here as i was there? now i wonder,  why am i feeling the way i do --so much longing. now i wonder,  why i'm thinking there used to be more to life than all of this. what is she hiding?  i sense it on her touch, i wish she wasn't so distant. i taste it on her kiss. what is it that she's missing?  she isn't getting w
