somewhere new. and i got to be much closer with my awesome brother.(thanks Billy)  i went home years later and had to deal with him in line at the supermarket.where he was so nonchalant and tried to make conversation. it took every ounce of my being not to punch him. Him with his three children and me with the memories i have to hold with me forever. the guilt i have to hide and cry about alone. the guilt of what i did, when if maybe he'd have called me, or just said 'i'm sorry' or ANYTHING it would have maybe helped me.this is ten years inside me, and hardly anyone knows this about me.but if i didn't write it out today, i might just cry myself into oblivion.i'm thankful for my friends that took care of me, for my Mommy, and Billy.and i thank Ben for writing that song and for making me cry a million times, but in a good way.   and thanks, Ben Folds, for being a real man.
I find that there are times when i long for certain times back in the Poconos...  I just miss my old friends and family in Pennsylvania a lot right now. I miss Julie and i going out to Floods, SSG, Frow and listening to Kevin and Toby play thier always great sets of songs i really adore. I miss my mommy. i miss Camelback mountain and the fireworks. i miss hanging out with patrice, morgan and greg. i miss the 4$ movie theatre. i miss my car and the freedom of driving. I miss James Hearn and Wawa and Amaris and Alison and Mike Weendra the voodoo lady guy and all the adorable folks that loved to go see the Duo. I miss all my cats. I miss fat Texxaco and Grendel that now live with Greg. I miss my old house. i miss Gallery Of Sound and thier excellent prices on CD's, and the cool guy that worked there that would give me posters and free stuff. I miss Stroudsburg and Main Street Music. I miss Sideshow Skip, The "Greatest Percussionist in ALL THE LAND" and Matt "Math" Abell. I miss BEN AND WILBIUM.I miss Perkins at 3 am. I miss Patrice so much, i miss hanging out at her house and playing with the doggies, and the evilest cat alive, Kiki.I miss clam castanets. i miss The Boathouse.I miss Rich Fogg and going on adventures together. i miss Robbin and Hooverball. i miss Greg Hugs and the way he smiles when i would come by his little house to visit. just because we're not in love and married does not mean he does not mean anything to me.I miss lunch with Mommie, or the way she comes out of her little house in her housedress, always with a cute story to tell. i miss the mountains.  But, I really, really LOVE Boston and everything i have found here.More than i could ever fit into a paragraph.  "Who's ever going to ever know the world before it goes?"-Jack K
