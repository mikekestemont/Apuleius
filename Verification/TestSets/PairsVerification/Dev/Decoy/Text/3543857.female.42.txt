Alley & Si came to stay this weekend.  They arrived about 6pm on Saturday.  Now I know where I live is not the most interesting of places, but it does have its good points.  Like it’s close to Heathrow.  Alley & Si are off to New Zealand for a year.  Alley has a working visa & Si just has a tourist visa. Lazing around in New Zealand for a whole year – lucky, lucky buggers.  I wanted to give them something typically English for supper for their last night in the UK.  So John & Si went to a local chip shop & we had fish & chips.  Then for dessert I had brought in strawberries & cream.  Last night was a bit nippy, but we endured and sat outside until about midnight. Well, it is going to be even colder in New Zealand this time of year (about 9 degrees) so they are going to have to get used to it.  I entertained everyone with my poi.  The glowing ones are very effective.  Especially as everyone was slightly tipsy.  We had lazy morning and then about noon we took them off to the airport.  I took my camera so I could take a piccie of them before they left.  I hate saying goodbye to people, but they needed someone to see them off.  We went into the terminal with them, and after Si had had a full body cavity search – only joking - they had to have theirs bags searched coz they were flying via LA, we had a coffee.  I said that we would wave across the water to them on Christmas day when we are in Australia.  So after some conversation, where I desperately tried not to blub (I think I did quite well) we took them to departures & said our good-byes.  It was once we got home that I remembered my camera in my bag – bugger.  If the plane took off on time they will have been flying for about 6 hours now.  I’m not envious or jealous, but I’m definitely something.  And although we have not seen them much this year – we will miss them.  We wish them all the luck in the world and hope they have the best time ever.  We are up the Heathrow again on Wednesday to collect Dom, Sarah & young master Sam as they are coming back after two years in Dubai.  Dom will have to go back for a couple of weeks after Glastonbury.  So we will be up & down from Heathrow like a yo-yo over the next month or two.  We will all be going camping in Cornwall in mid July for a week before Dom, Sarah and young master Sam will all be off on a years world tour.  Again lucky, lucky buggers.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  Take care.
