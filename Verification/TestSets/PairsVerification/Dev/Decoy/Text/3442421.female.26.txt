I bet there are 1000's of blogs out there with "it starts" as there title entry. perhaps that is a sign of what it is come from this blog, yet another waste of realestate in cyberspace. Let it be known, "i love cyber space"  I do not have any particular reason for starting a blog. I was on blogspot looking for Sexinthelibrary [with out and luck] and noticed how easy it was for me to open an account and start the process. So there you have it, my first post.
ok- I feel this is the first of many blogshattering posts. I may have found a purpose for this thing after all. I believe I am on the verge of doing something incredible.   ANOTE FROM THE WRITER: take incredible lightly, it is a subjective word. my terms of incrediblity are certainly different from yours.  On sunday my sister made me a video tape with her miniDV camera and overnighted it to me. I spent most of the weekend waiting to hear what would be on the tape, then I woke up Monday counting the hours until the tape would arrive. That morning i pulled out my DV camera, pluged it into my TV and an electrical outlet. Everything was ready, when I arrived home from work for my lunch break, the tape would be there.

So I returned to my job a bit defeated. For most of the afternoon I bide my time waiting for the moment I could leave and begin my journey to the North Fedex branch. SURPRIZE.. my husband is getting off  work early and will pick up the package. In the package is the tape.  Now all I have to do is get home with dinner, sit down and watch the tape.  not so.  My DV camera decides last night would be a good night to break.  To the computer for trouble shooting, calling friends to find a camcoder we can borrow. Finally after several (3) hours without any luck I demand we go to Best Buy. Surely the electronic super store will have something that will allow me to watch this tape.  but no.....
to sparkle is to penetrate others with your energy. i love to sparkle. i wonder why it is hard to sparkle? Last night I was told to sparkle, which was a nice way of spinning (spinning, spinning, spinning) on shumooze and mingle. I was a bit hurt. I didn't want to be t
