Now playing on iTunes:  Lifehouse "Hanging By a Moment"  I'm not a huge fan of Lifehouse.  Well, they're okay, but not something I want to listen to right now.  Tonight it seems like iTunes has a premeditated mission to play depressing music and make me feel worse about my pithy problems. So guess what? I'm gonna write about them here as long as my MP3's have me thinking about it.  So uh, take a piss or grab some water or whatever. this will probably be long.  I am probably gonna be fired from my job.  This doesn't please me, especially since it's one of the stupidest things one can get terminated over: short lunches.  I know it sounds dumb, but I'm already about to be suspended because of it.  So I did what seemed sensible to me.. I started scouting out other jobs and applied for one.  The only problem is I'm not exactly unemployed yet.  I just have this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that this whole mess will blow up in my face.  I put down a couple of close friends in the company as business references, mostly because I've held my current job for about 6 years and know tons of people.  But things like my situation have a tendency to spread around pretty fast, and if it reaches any of the management staff I'm certain to lose my job, even if I don't really want to.  I love the people I work with, I love the physical aspects of my job, I love the fact that I can get sweet discounts on electronic gear, but on the other hand, the company seems to want to drive everyone away.  I get to withdraw from my sociology class, because I somehow managed to suck really badly at it, and I don't really want a fail destroying my GPA.  I already told my dad, but I'm having a super-hard time figuring out how to tell my mom.   She just looks so proud when she tells everyone how well I'm doing, I can't bear the thought of how the news that I'm not actually doing that great will affect her.  I just wish I knew how she'd react before I tried to tell her, so I could brace myself.  This just in: I'm pretty damn sick of being alone.  I guess I just don't understand why it is I'm not attractive or whatever.  Well I understand it, but I don't understand how to get people to look past that.  I mean, I think i'm a decent guy, I just don't think girls look for decent guys anymore.  It seems like the guy can be just an utter and complete cock as long as he is good looking.  That kinda sucks.  I just wish I could find someone.  Becky says that I just need to be patient and someone will come along, but I'm not a very patient cat.  So yeah.  There's so much more I feel about this but there is no possible way to express it.  s
