Ah, my first publishing attempt. In secret, at work, no less!
Had a mongo fight with the BF today. I loathe attempting to even elaborate on it, but suffice it to say I was uninvited for dinner tonight and I do believe I will be sleeping in tomorrow. An odd way to get what I wanted in the first place. Oh happy day. I'd write more in my angry rage but that would not be polite, and apparently that does not make me a fun person to be around.   today was the big vet visit for Gord, getting out, seeing the world, that crazy hedgehog. The vet loved him and he's in great health. How weird that I felt proud that she gushed of my hedgehog, like I have anything to do with his cuteness. Anyway, I'd saw it was a success.  I saw 'monster' today and I felt a bit disturbed afterwards. charlize theron was surprisingly good. What got to me though is that the film adds a totally moralistic device at the end to remind people that she is a monster, like they were afraid she may be too sympathetic at that point. It always makes me wonder, and I found the discussion of circumstances pretty interesting.
Can't explain why but I am highly annoyed with just about everything today. I just found out I am in for another 3-4 month stint at work of serious overtime and little appreciation. Last summer was 16 weeks of 6 days a week of work with overtime, I am not too pleased about doing a second round. Its interesting to be told from the start we have deadlines we can't meet, usually they save that for midway through to trick us into working overtime to make up the difference. I think it's a bad sign.  my teeth are really sensitive today. Its day 4 of the whitestrip test, I am concerned I will have to drop it if my teeth get much more tingly. But they are really getting white! Darn...  day two of the diet. I had a hunger headache yesterday. Already! I am so in my own head about it. Anyway, its going to be tough, my family is sometimes my biggest obstacle. They take it as a personal affront when I diet, like somehow they are living through it themselves, and they hate it. They complain and they bring it up in 20 minute intervals. I regret telling them already. I just figure if i tell people i will be more likely to keep up with it. (and i checked this morning, i'm 2 pounds lighter, woohoo!)  tomorrow is Gord's first vet appointment, I know it will be an adventure. Taking a hedgehog to the vet is not something I thought I'd ever do, but I find everything about Gord funny. how pissy, compulsive and obsessive he is. reminds me of me (I guess that seems obvious) I really hope he 'un-balls' so the vet can look at him, it would suck if he needed to be knocked out or s
