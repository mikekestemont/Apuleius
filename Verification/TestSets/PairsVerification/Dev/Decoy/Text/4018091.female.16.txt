Okay, so yesterday I had so much fun. I went to Talent Night for the cheerleaders at Incarnate Word with Shean, Michael, and Patrick. Three hilarious guys. It was so much fun. The cheerleaders did really good. The dance was too cute. Good job girls..If any of ya'll read this. I sat with Levi and Ashley ((Lay)) the whole time and Levi was all freakin over me. It was kinda funny though. So everyone saw my black hair and I was really surprised by what they said...They all liked it..Unless they were lying to me! haha, who knows? Then afterwards, we went to Whataburger and talked about sex and shit. haha. It was really funny. Then we dropped off Michael then Shean took me home. Later, around 12:30 me and Kristin went to Jack in the Box and when I got home, Cody called me and came over. He was over until about 1:30 I guess. And then I came inside. I didn't freakin go to bed until like 6:30. It was horrible. I hate doing that. On a lighter note, I'm SO excited to go to Brittany's sweet 16, we're going to hit up downtown for sure!! Haha, I can't wait! Well, I'm gonna go. Byee!!
