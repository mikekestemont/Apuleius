Well, ya, its been a really long time since I last updated this blog. The reason being... I've been busy. Anyway, I'm at home alone at lunch, and have 6 minutes until I have to leave to go back to school.   CSI is one of the best TV shows on TV at the moment. That, and 8 Simple Rules, obviously. Anyway, the other spin off shows are not as good as just plain old CSI. I have a fiction book about it too which I've been reading this past week, and plan to read another one after I finish too. I wonder when that will be, sometime this week probably.  Our form tutor was away all last week and today too, so thats really good. She's so nasy, our previous form tutor went on maternity leave. When we had her we were 9TE, now since we have the new one, she changed us to 9WL! I have NEVER EVER signed a piece of paper with my name on saying that I am in WL, and I never will do!

Ms Lonsdale was really nice to me in French today, she told me about Ms Tindles baby, and said she would tell her that we have made her a card (we have, but haven't got everybody to sign it). Honestly, forget what I said in Mondays post.  Can't think of much else to say, so I will probably either write tonight or tomorrow.
WOW! Today was the hotest day of the year so far! I dunno by how much, but it was really hot all day! Also, today was the first day since the 1800's in which the planet Venus passed infront of the Sun! I didn't get a chance to see it because I was in school and you can't look at it with your naked eye.  Anyho, at school we returned back to Product Design, which is a million times better than Food Tech, because the teachers are better and... who want's to cook food, anyway, after watching Gordon Rammsay's "Hell's Kitchen".  CAD - Carefuly Aplied Deodrant! What's that!? You DON'T use deodrant? Shame on you, shame on you! You smelly little toerag, you must start wearing a range of plesant smelling fr√©quence's. Nah, never mind, I just wanted to tell you that James put the above down in his Manufacturing test, and still got a higher mark than me!  Today we had Ms Seath instead of Mrs Turner for Music, it was a really nice change since all w
