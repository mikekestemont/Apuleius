I have a phone, I feel like I am repeating myself to all those that I have talked to, but for those who I haven't talked to, here you are.  On Saturday, I went back into Halifax for the Buskers Festival taking place on the Harbour-we saw this guy who can fit his entire body through a stringless tennis racket!  Then, I went to Point Pleasant Park to see the aftermath of the Sept./03 hurricane, and the Atlantic Ocean.  Work is picking up pace again, with VBS around the corner.  I went to SOO many dollar stores today, and you would think that SOMEONE would have black streamers and balloons, seeing that they're so common-place (and NO, it's not a goth-themed VBS, it's construction-I picked up yellow ones already!).  NOW, I am writing in this here blog right in the Dartmouth Public Library-they have finally issued me a card, so i consider my self a full-fledged Nova Scotian (well, not quite...).  ANYWHO, that's what's up for me right now, what's up with you?  LATERZ.
Yes, that is correct-Aliant has surprised me, and given me a phone line faster than expected (seeing that they're on strike and everything).  This morning I woke up, checked my phone (like ALWAYS), and WHAM-dial tone!  First thing I did was call my folks at 6am (much to their chagrin!).  It's been a while since I wrote in this thing, but I have been without computer for quite sometime, so I appologize PROFUSELY!  Things here are just dandy-the weekend was rather slow, but with the happenings of Natal Day, I got to entertain myself somewhat.  And now that the new week is well under way, work has picked up its' pace a bit.  We're heading into VBS-land pretty soon, and there's a group coming from Kitchener/Waterloo to help, so I actually have stuff to do now!  I'm all settled in my little (I mean microscopic) apartment, and I am quite fond of the area.  Right near 2 lakes, and there's ducks EVERYWHERE.  Tonight my friend Lisa (from home, but now living in Antigonish) is staying the night, and we're going to bomb around Halifax tomorrow (I'll finally be able to be a tourist!).  Other than that, I went to Stats Canada yesterday to pick up the 2001 Census-MAN, what a scary place-locked up tighter than Fort Knox!  One difference I totally notice out here is how friendly the people are-I'm living in a city, but it often feels like a small town (I love that).  I haven't really met anyone yet, but I'm sure that will just take time-I'm getting more used to spending time alone, and I think it's good for me to be content with that.  When you're not busy socializing, it's amazing what one can keep oneself busy with-I'm actually keeping my house clean, filing stuff, putting stuff IN drawers (for those of you who knew my last living condition KNOW that it wasn't that way!)  ANYWHO-lunch is on, and if you want my phone number/mailing address, just email me at  urlLink rooshootles@hotmail.com  .  L
