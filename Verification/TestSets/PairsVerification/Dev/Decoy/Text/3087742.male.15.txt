have for a story, a Sci-Fi story based off a pen and paper RPG I made. This section of the story is based around one kid named Haimanton (pronounced like hey-mon-tōn) later nicknamed Weird Kendo Guy. I hope you enjoy.
The bunkhouse seemed lifeless as they entered, despite the dozen inside. The dozen was made up of five children, about Haimanton's age (no doubt all were orphans like Haimanton) and seven young men, that all looked at Haimanton as if he were a freak. The young boy merely held closer to his kodachis and glared at everyone inside. A small whisper came about the room as if wind, and was gone just as quick, but Haimanton remained quiet and still. If not for the color in his body, one might have mistaken him for a statue. "This is Haimanton." Shaikonra finally broke the eerie silence. "I trust you will take care of him like any other rookie." Another whisper came and fell like the last, quiet snickering could be heard throughout the room. Shaikonra gave Haimanton a shove, and instantly, the door shut behind him. There was now no way out, and nothing standing between him and the rest of the inhabitants of the bunkhouse. It wasn't long before one of the men got to his feet, and walked up to the child. He looked at Haimanton, up and down, inspecting him, memorizing him, trying to find possible weaknesses. "I'm Karugh (cā-rook)," the man said with a rough voice. "I'm the drill leader of this bunkhouse." Haimanton instinctively reached out to shake his hand, in hopes that his wish to make peace would be accepted, but this gesture was immediately rebuked with a, "Don't be stupid," from Karugh. "There's one rule in this bunk, and that's that I'm in charge, everything I say, goes," is what he tried to say, but half way through this speech of his mouth closed shut, and laughter from the children's side of the room soon followed. One child, a Pyrod (pī-rōd, half man, half feline), stopped laughing, though, as he was pulled through the air, and stopped in front of Karugh. Karugh's mouth reopened, and the first this out of it was "I've had enough of this from you, Garruw (Gār-roo)!" Garruw hung in the air, looking quite comfortable, a large grin stretched across his face. He glanced at Haimanton almost as if to say, 'This better be worth it,' then set his focus back on Karugh.
Sorry about all the confusing names and stuff, the reason it's all weird and stuff is because it's not in English. Instead, it is in a common tongue that I do not yet have a name for. Also, all the ai=ey and stuff is because the language has its own symbols, that is supposed to be a type of phonetic spelling. And don't ask about the oi=ee thing, I don't know what I was thinking, but that's the way it is now. I can't change it. Oh, and Shaikonra's name is pronounced different for a reason, you'll find out l
