wet, dismembered limbs frolicking in burnt lasagna from cardboard packages were haunting me. Onward I stalked the wet asphalt beneath my fluvoged feet.  Thai was not to be my gourmet lover tonight. I would have to find another delight. Deserts whispered sweet nothings in my ear but its aromas didn't reach me enough to tempt me. Not until I walked on by a former one night stand that I new I had found what I needed to satiate my appetite this evening. Chicken Tikka and me had a round of nibbles and bites.   I chewed lovingly on his tender morsels of spiced breast of fowl.

I saw Farenheit 9-11 the other day. I took my friend Heather for her birthday. A beautiful and sunny Saturday and all was well. 2 hours later a hole had been ripped in the cheap veneer of the false reality I had considered to be somewhat true. The fantasy of my percieved reality poured through the tear like the blood through the sheared flesh of my knee after it shredded along the rough pavement of the decrepet east van step last week. Like then, I could do nothing more than wince from the wound, and maybe shed a few tears. Eventually I just had to shrug my shoulders and get up and go on my way. As it was then, I said to myself upon leaving the theatre, "What can I do? I guess I'll find a bandaid l
