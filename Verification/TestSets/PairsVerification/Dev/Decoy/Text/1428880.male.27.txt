A Downey Deal   Part of the fun of having digital cable is watching local advertising from affiliates across the country, in different time zones.  Last night I saw an ad for " urlLink Downey Ford in St. John, NB ", which asked viewers "Why did you buy your car at Downey Ford"?  Was it because of the attractive sales staff?  (Pan across a series of small town faces.  Many with mullet and moustache combinations.) Was it because of the fast paced sales pitch?  (Clip of a hilariously sped-up version of a salesman showing a car to two people) Or...was it because you got a " DOWNEY DEAL !!"?  I laughed and laughed and laughed.  Partially at the Sony Handi-cam quality of the commerical.  But mainly at "The Downey Deal".
Time to shift the War   So...in the last 20 or so years we've endured the Cold War, the War on Drugs, the First Gulf War, the War on Terror, the Second Gulf War, and now....The War on Potholes.  You may remember that Edison, NJ is the  urlLink birthplace of recorded sound , but what you may not know, is that it is also ground zero for the  urlLink War on Potholes .  I challenge any pothole to test the resolve of Edison Mayor George A. Spadoro and the people of Edison, New Jersey on this issue.    Potholes can be eliminated, from Edison in our lifetime.    I would further propose that after filling each pothole, the works crew recite the  urlLink Pledge of Allegiance  and insert a small flag into the soft, warm  urlLink asphalt .  This will send a message to our enemys that even on the homefront, we are prepared to go the full distance, and make the ultimate sacrifice to protect the integrity of our suspensions, and our senior citizen's ankles.  Goodnight, and may God continue to bless America.
Chretien's Father    urlLink Chretien agrees that posession of pot shouldn't give someone a criminal record  which is, a step in the right direction.  It would be a leap in the right direction for people serving 10 year prison sentances in the States for posession of pot; but they're not the ones living in Canada.  Pity.  Here's the most intriguing statement from Chretien's address at a Liberal fundraiser last night:  Chretien said that, in his youth, marijuana wasn't known. "I never tasted it." But he smoked cigarettes, when his father told him not to. "When he gave me permission at 16, I stopped." Who's father "gives them permission" to start smoking cigarettes?
The Gaberdeen Army   I took a different path to work today.  For those who don't ride the streetcar in the east end, I'll let you know that the 504 now takes Broadview to King, then King to Church.  It's at this point that the streetcar embarks on a magical mystery tour of the downtown core, making lefts and rights on Richmond, Victoria, and Queen.  That little "jog" takes about 10 minutes, and as I found out this morning, it takes exactly the same amount of time to walk from King and Church, g
