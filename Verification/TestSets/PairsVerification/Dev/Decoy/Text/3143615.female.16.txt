What happens when you push away the love of your life? Is it over? No, Not totally, never really. No love never dies, true love is always there inside you.  And even on your saddest days it springs up in your emotions. A well that never dries. I wish not to hate those who have hurt me, but thank what has grown out of me and grown into me. What we must go through and what we put ourselves through is all for good.  Fate? What is Fate? God has our fate in his hands, it is weather we accept it. He holds it out to us, but we must except and take it and hold on to it with every bone we have. Because once you let go,  It is like a Butterfly once you opened your hands it will fly away to its own rest of its own choice. What is love? How is it that I find myself in love yet in so much hurt?  Is this what love is? If so why should I love? Who knows what love truly is? Love is such a powerful word and with so much hurt comes with it, yet without it we are empty. What would happen if I never had let myself fall in love? Would I be better off? Or the same? I miss you so much; you are part of me,  But you are not mine. You are not mine. You are no ones,  You Gods. So fly to him, fly into his palms and remember me when you go. Remember me. As I look to the sky I see your face, I see your smile. I hear your voice in the air. But can you hear me? And what happens when you realize you are the reason for your love going away? And that you just can’t go on anymore, and that maybe you were in a fairy tale and you closed the book. How do you go on? By Grace of God. But would of you can’t go were he is, because it isn’t your time. Just fly away, and remember when you look back remember every day is eternality. But would of this love come back to you? And what of that “you” was me? And you knew you screwed up? What would you do? Because you know you were on fire with that person near. But does it go out? Doe sit go away? Does this pain leave? When will it go? Will it? But is it good? Am I still on fire? Because he was on fire for something much higher than you, For a higher reason on earth then for you. Would of he wasn’t of this earth? What would you do? Would you be on fire too? What does it mean to be on fire? Only you will know. And when you do, Will you understand it? Will you fly away too?
What is my life worth? Does anything even matter? I fail at most things, yet i am accompleshed i
