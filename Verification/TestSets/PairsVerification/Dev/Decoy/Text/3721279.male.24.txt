Okay, so it's important to begin by stating that I am one of the biggest Spider-Man fans in all of mankind. I've loved Spider-Man for as long as I can recall, and typically mistake myself for him, though thankfully this has never occurred near the edge of any tall buildings. I supported and enjoyed the first film, even with the slight creative changes that they made to his costume, powers, and villains. But damn, let me tell you, Spider-Man 2 hit the bullseye in ways I never dreamed possible.   In one film, the writers managed to incorporate plot elements that took decades to establish in comics. The action is a whirlwind of intensity, the special effects some of the most seamless and realistic I've ever seen. All of the acting has improved from the first, and the humor is dead on and frequent. I even thought Kirsten Dunst finally became Mary Jane near the end of the film (not to knock her ability, but I just didn't initially agree with her casting or the writing of her role).  This movie does to the first Spidey film what X2 did to X-Men...it blew it out of the water. It's not that the first film was bad by any stretch of the word, but this movie is Spider-Man done with a freedom that allows for true homage to the character. This film felt as though it was truly a comic book story, full of love, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, and someone decided to rip it out of its pages and paste it up on the big screen.  So now that I've given you my completely spoiler-free review of Spider-Man 2, regardless of whether or not you even care about the good 'ole Web Head, I should probably just shut up and let you go see it...if you so choose. Until next time, this is your friendly neighborhood Spi....(cough)...Dave, signing off and passing out.
I was rather "off" yesterday. Or at least, I was off in the evening hours. I couldn't even drive right. My roommates find this humorous, and enjoy poking fun at me, and though I act like they're really pissing me off, I know they mean no real harm.  We went bowling. I figured it would be a good time, hanging out with Robb, Brian, Fred, Amanda, and Andy, all of whom are better bowlers than I am...but that's nothing new. :) I had not gone bowling in a while, because it was something I used to really only do with my ex-girlfriend Joanne. It's kind of like how I only really ever smoke cigars with my friend Oliver. There's just some kind of quality to the experience that I really only enjoy with certain people. Ever get that feeling?  So we get there, and I'm looking for a ball, and Fred is waiting patiently for us, having already punched our super hero alter egos into the score board instead of our real names. Man, I love Fred. :) And then I say to myself, "Well Dave, you obviously need a b
