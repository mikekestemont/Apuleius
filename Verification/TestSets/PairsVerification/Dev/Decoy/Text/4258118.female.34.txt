because i'm captain of the football team? no. is it because i get straight a's? no. is it because i'm NHS president? no. is it because my favorite color is orange? yes. i mean, think about it. who else likes orange? nobody! i'm it! the ONLY PERSON!! you're looking at (sort of) the last remaining member of the orange tribe! if that doesn't set me apart from the riffraff, what does? let's face it, when halloween comes around and you all are shuddering at the tacky decorations, im loving it all. I should get extra points for that.
Maddie's crazy.  I'm Chip Daily from Midland, Texas and my favorite color is orange.  See?  Reality doesn't suck that much!
According to Caroline Richmond of  urlLink Oldie Magazine , "Blogs are a dream come true for exhibitionists and bores. " I have to say that after browsing through a couple dozen of them yesterday, she is, for the most part, right on the money.  So why am I writing one myself? Because, no matter how much I want to believe it isn't true, I'm just like you.  I don't think it's so much that we're exhibitionists, as that we want to have a voice. We want to believe that somehow what we have to say is interesting or meaningful. We want to stand out in the sea of humanity and say, "Look at me! I'm special! I exist! I had something to say!" I don't believe that as individuals any of us are very special, but as a whole, we're rather interesting.  I considered how much to say about myself in this blog.... do I give my friends and family  urlLink witty nicknames  to disguise their identity? Do I fall into the internet anonymity trap, believing that if I keep my name to myself, I can somehow disguise who I am, start fresh, give you the impression that I'm somehow a little bit cooler, a little bit wittier, a woman of intrigue and mystery behind this vague internet mask called "Maddaleigh". Or, on the other hand, do I include my real name, my photo, and where I live, making this a bare portrait of what I consider to be reality?  I think the former. Because I know myself, I know that if I post my real name, and perhaps something of my professional writing, I'll self-edit.  This blog will become nothing more than a marketing piece and I'll create some super-woman blog, portraying myself as hard-working, infinitely creative, or particularly wise.  On my best days I'm those things, but rarely all at once.  I expect this blog to be full of opinions and ideas, rather than a diary of what I do from day to day.  I go to the store, I have conversations, I do my work, I watch some telly, and all of those other in between things like making the bed and sweeping corn-flies off the window ledges.   For 99% of the population, it's not what we  do  that makes us interesting, but what we  think .  So.... here I am... t
