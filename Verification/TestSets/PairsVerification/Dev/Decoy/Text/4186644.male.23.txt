So its Tuesday morning and Im here at work doing absolutely nothing but thinking of what  my official first entry should be for my blog.  What just so happens to spring into my mind? The approaching winter swell, thats what.  Recolections of days past and moments permanently burned into my minds eye.  Teh kind of memories that enable thought and the five senses to work together for one hell of a day dream. including glassy water, the light mist and raindrops of a hawaiian winter and barreling, rideable surf. You see reader, I have an obsession. An obsession with surfing these warm hawaiian waters and the drug called Stoke. The more stoke you taste, the more clarity and simplicity you add to your life. Hmmm, simplicity by adding more? You bet you sweet ass. I know its not very Tao of JKD to say so, but sorry Mr. Bruce Lee, this is one application where your rules do not apply, well at least in this sense.  But I digress, lets get back on topic.  Looking out side I see variable rain. Slow, purposfull fatty drops. Sheer, speeding, thin drops. You name it. Thats Hawaii rain for you. If you dont like it, just wait 10 minutes. One thing always remains constant though, well at least to me. Its always warmer than it looks. All my life Ive lived here, 23 years (nobody likes you when your 23 BTW, [/life] ), And every time I can remember playing in this falling liquid I recall it bieng warm and inviting.  Refreshing and pleasent mind you, its not like God's Urine kind of warm! Now rewind to one of my greatest days out in the water............./squigly dream sequence lines.blurr and fade..............LOL  ....  It was a rainy september morning, about 530AHT (am hawaiian time) . The previous days poundings still rippled fresh in my mind. So did the drunken sotries of heavy water that lulled me to sleep that night. Then that haunting wave. The one that hugged me tight and wouldnt send me skipping out of her love tube till she was satisfied. My moment of zen. The drug that calls many young men from their comfortable beds on a rainy saturday morning, Stoke. Gotta get my stoke on. I hop out of bed already dressed for the ocassion. (Who doesnt sleep in their board shorts? Its the perfect PJ's. ) And procedd to the bathroom. Ritual morning piss, brushing of teeth and sweeping out the sand from last nights shower before mom gets up and whoops my ass. Too easy. Back to the room, and it is time to sit and think, real, real hard. Transportation was an issue back then so planning the perfect bus route to expedite our journey is a must. Obviously were headed to the north shore, bur its how we get there that would determine the supplies we would have available to us that day, out at the bay (Waimea), where the nearest lunch wagon or bathroom is football fields away from you up hill in white s
