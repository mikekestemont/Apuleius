just getting back up to normal ground where you started will be enough of a struggle and take enough time, let alone going for the top again. Let's just stop it all right now. You're at the bottom. Everything sucks. Every time you try to climb up there it just all ends in tears. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Why bother? You see other people around you climb up but you can't. Seems as soon as you get out of this shithole, you fall back in. Why, why, why can't I get out of this shit? Even just stay on level ground? Why am I so fucked up?  This is usually the angry depression, and it's the worst. It usually takes a few days up to a week to get through this. Seems no matter what I do or try to think I just can't get out. As soon as I have a spare moment when I'm not trying to concentrate on some task at hand, BANG!, it's right there. And it does get hard to concentrate. You get 2-3 hours sleep a night because :   (A) you can't get to sleep to start with because your mind is busying thinking about the shit making you depressed and how much you wished you were normal;   (B) once you fall sleep you keep having dreams like cutting your legs off or killing the next stranger you see walking down the street;   (C) you're awake now and back to (A).     When you are awake you are full of "angry energy" - you are so angry you can't stop grinding your teeth, tapping your feet, hitting the desk, pacing back and forth, clenching your fists, etc. Ready to explode. Screw Yoda, if you could use The Force you could destroy whole fucken planets, forget needing the Death Star. You wish you could spontaneously combust. Get this shit over with. I'm over it.    Slowly I'll seem to change from "angry" to "apathy". I'll still have that energy. Kill myself yes, but not anyone else. I'll wake up in the morning and think "Oh great, another shitty day in my shitty life. Why the hell do I bother? It'd be much easier to just skol a bottle of vodka and end it." Or drive my car under a truck. Or overdose on heroin. Or blow my brains out. Or jump off a building.    So I'll be at work, trying to concentrate but can't stop thinking "You're fucked up. You'll never fix your head. End it. Do the world a favour." Then I start thinking about my funeral. Would they bother telling anyone? If they did, would anyone come? How many people that I think are my friends would be there? Should I find out now?    Although I can write that there is one thing that will pull me up out of the valley like a bungie cord - the same thing that got me to the top of the cliff. But does that happen? No. Why do you think I "slipped" in the first p
