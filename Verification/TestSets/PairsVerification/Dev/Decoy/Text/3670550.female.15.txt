Well, Evan forgave me and I told Chris to stop calling. Dee and I have been talking even more than we did in the first place and everyone's happy. I've been to the mall twice this past week and my collection of summer clothes has grown a lot! Tomorrow I have to go to a banquet for Dee's pageant and then Evan and I are going out for a bite to eat. Thursday is the big day of the pageant. Dee is nervous, but I have a good feeling about it. I think she'll win something. So, good luck to you Dee! :) I know this post is really short, but, I have got to go and eat before I die of starvation!     ♪: Jadakiss - Why Mood: Hungry
Well, as I said in my last post, Chris has been calling me. He called me Sunday and yesterday too. I saw nothing wrong with talking to him so I always answered and talked to him for a while. Well okay, so it was more like a few hours. But that's not the point. Evan came here yesterday as soon as he got back in town. He was playing with my phone when--surprise surprise--Chris called. I snatched the phone from Evan before he had the chance to answer it and start to bitch. I hit the "decline" button as quickly as I could and sent the call to my voicemail. But Evan had already realized what has been going on because I had told him about the call at 4 a.m. when Dee answered. He stormed out without even giving me the chance to explain and only called once later that night--to talk to Dee. Luckily, my sister gave me the chance to tell her what has been happening. She listened to my side of the story, and didn't turn her back on me. She's still just the same as she was. She told me that if I really wanted to, she wouldn't give me a hard time about anything I did with him. However, she also told me that if he fucks up, she'll be sure to step in. College or no college she's going to be a big part of this. I love her for that. Now all I have to do is decide what I want.    ♪: VH1 Mood: Confused
Today Dee is off work again. She gets Sundays and Mondays off. This week, she gets only Sunday off because she took Friday off. It's the busiest day at the restaurant. We aren't doing anything special today. I guess all I'll be doing is getting online and watching TV. Evan is at a family reunion in Ohio somewhere. He isn't going to be back until tomorrow evening. Chris called again last night while Dee was at work. I talked to him for almost two hours. He told me that he was sorry that he called at 4 a.m. on Friday. Then, he went ahead and started telling me all about how much he missed me. He said that he was s
