I was chatting with a friend of mine and the topic of SPM came out. I was telling her about the pressure I feel to face the exam on 4th december when she suddenly slap my hand! "4th december??? are u crazy or what?" that's what she said. and guess what... then I realized that the exam is not on 4th december ... but it's on 4th november!!!! how could I forgot the real date??I must be crazy.. it's an important exam. She laughed histerically ( so histerically that I hope she's not my friend at that time... ppl starred at us that's why) she said that she  just couldn't accept me being that ignorant on the date... hmmm.. this thursday I'll be sitting for history. GOD, give me strength.. I HATE history!!  okay.. I need to continue my study (history... arggghh!!)
been a few days with no new entry. I guess I'm feeling different today so I decided to write. Okay... my TRIAL SPM exam will start this thursday and I'm NOT finish studying yet! 2004 is a tiring year for me. test, test, test,test,test, test and the real exam. I'm feeling nervous now. Start this thursday, and a week break start from saturday and then the exam will continue after that, is it tiring? of course it is! The trial will end on 17th Sept. and then I'll be facing the real SPM exam in november. ah wait... not november...my subject start on 4th december to be exact. but my friends who takes extra subjects will start earlier than me and that will be in november. Remember, 4th December 2004 will be my suffering day!! *broken*  I'm buying V6 concerts from a seller from singapore. Before, I think I've been ripped off, that she don't reply my 5 e-mails. And guess what,at last she replied! *wink* apologizing for replying a bit late and told me that she's going to give me a gift bcos of that.. woot :hehe: couldn't wait for it to arrive. I wonder how's the arashi poster that I sent to Liss is 'doing' . I posted that one the same day I posted the payment to the V6 seller.. oh wait she is in S'pore while liss is in Canada.. it takes time, I know :broken again: .I hope it'll be safely receive by liss *finger cross*
