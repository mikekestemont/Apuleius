Surveillance footage from Washington's Dulles Airport on September 11, 2001 shows security personnel searching several of the hijackers who commandeered a plane and crashed it into the Pentagon later that day.     The newly-released video footage shows at least three of the five hijackers setting off metal detectors and being pulled aside and checked with hand-held detectors before being allowed to board the aircraft.     Authorities believe the men carried utility knives either personally or in their luggage.  The hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was flown into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people on board and 125 on the ground.     The attack came after al-Qaida members had flown two other planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City.
The hits just keep on coming for Michael Eisner -- and not necessarily the good kind. The Disney chief executive, under fire for apparently driving away Steve Jobs's Pixar Animation unit, now has to watch his one-time studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg take dead aim at Disney's animation stronghold. Katzenberg, who in 1994 left Disney to form DreamWorks SKG with fellow moguls David Geffen and Steven Spielberg, will head DreamWorks soon-to-be spun-off animation unit, which filed its initial public offering on July 21.    The announcement that Katzenberg will head the publicly traded company is just DreamWorks' latest shot across Disney's -- and Eisner's -- bow. DreamWorks' Shrek 2, released in late May, has grossed more than $410 million at the U.S. box office, pretty much trampling prospects for Disney's animated Home on the Range, which has grossed a dismal $49 million. With its IPO, DreamWorks intends to raise $650 million, of which it says it will retain $175 million to make two computer-generated films a year.     Disney has said that it's gearing up its own animated-film unit to make computer-generated flicks, having determined that the market for traditionally hand-drawn films has begun to wane, but DreamWorks clearly has a headstart.       KEEPING PRIVATE. &nbsp; Insiders have been saying for months that an IPO was coming, in large part so that Katzenberg and his fellow moguls could reward employees who have largely worked without bonuses as the company has suffered intermittent dry spells with its live-action films and TV series. Even last year, DreamWorks' animated unit lost $189 million, the IPO says, as hand-drawn films Sinbad and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron flopped at the box office.     DreamWorks says it has six computer-generated films in various stages of development through 2006, including one that sources say is Shrek 3, slated to open Christmas, 2006. Later this year, it will release Shark Tale, which features the voices of Will Smith and Robert De Niro. DreamWorks has said it, too, will likely no longer produce hand-drawn movies.     DreamWorks officials declined to comment on the IPO, because they're in a quiet period. The IPO is expected to go to market sometime later this year. But filings with the S
