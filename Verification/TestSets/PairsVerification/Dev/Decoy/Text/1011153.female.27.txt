The astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one.  This run was three minutes running, one minute walking--which is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio.  I was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and I really struggled through the 5th one.  Tonight I noticed a very odd sensation.  While I was happy to take the little walking breaks, I found that the moment I started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated.  I'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon.  However, I'm also sure there's  no  clever scientific name for the fact that I'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.
So the pressing question was whether I should increase my total running time or decrease my walking time.  Since the schedule I'm following says to increase running time, I decided to do that.  They're the experts, after all--I'm just the one in the expensive shoes.  While today didn't exactly feel what I would call "good," it didn't feel bad either.  Actually, after my third repetition I felt like a million bucks; after my fourth, I flagged a bit.  But I made it through to my 7th repetition without feeling like my lungs were inside out.  I probably could have done 8 repetitions, if the truth be told, but I'm sure I'll regret saying that on Wednesday.  Jon has just decided to go on a health kick too; he says that he's going to join me in running.  I think I might be a little bit too slow for him.  Today I definitely felt like a jogger rather than a runner--I think it has to do with the massive amount of crap (chocolate syrup, ice cream, crisps, pizza, etc.) I've been eating over the past couple of days.
I can assure you that it was not laughably easy.  It wasn't as hard as last time, but it still felt pretty painful.  I didn't start thinking I was going. to. die. until the 4th repetition, at which point I again told myself that I was only going to do 5 repetitions.  I even had all sorts of excuses figured out: I was running at midday in the sun; I was running in the park on uneven ground, I was feeling vaguely hung-over.  But in the end it was the thought of coming here and writing down the fact that I had wussed out that made me do the 6th repetition.  Now I have the reward of a hot bath.
Tonight I decided to decrease the walking time between the periods of running.  I did 2 minutes on, one minute off, repeated 6 times.  After the first 2 repetitions, I felt like I was going. to. die.  But the middle two were fine; I was on top of the world.  I considered only doing 5 repetitions, but when I finished the 5th, I was further away from my house than I expected, so I slogged on to a 6th.  The 6th repetition was a real struggle.  I was l
