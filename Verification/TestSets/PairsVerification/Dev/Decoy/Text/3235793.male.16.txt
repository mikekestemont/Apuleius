Short letter:  Shazleen,  As i sit here, watching the computer screen, an image of you popped-up, then i realised that the image, was one of both you and me together.. the one where we were together, outside the cinema at bugis, lookin' into each other's eyes..  I smiled, as i thought of that piture, and after i realised that it was actually, my screensaver..(hehe..)  I miss you so much hotcakes..(with syrup..) I'll hold on to you, Through thick and thin... You'll be the one i won't give up on, Unlike failed pasts and memories.. I'll try my best, To be there when you need me, To be there when you're down, To be he one who really listens, To be the one who cares, And, To be so much more...  Alamak, sounds like marriage vows.. hehe.. but yah.. i'll try within my powers, and the powers that God gives me, to hold on to you, cause i remembered your words, "i think you're the one.." well, to me, you are.. i'm a changed Irfan after your arrival, into my life, and i'm different..  to be honest, i'm not as rash, i'm not as stupid, i'm not as boring, i'm not as fucked-up, as i usually am.. pardon my language, but its the only way i can describe it.. you changed me.. i love you..  now, more than ever, i truly believe that, "love" is a hard word to say.. but i know, I LOVE YOU.. you'll be sleeping, but i hope you feel it in your heart, cause, i'm beside you wherever you are.. ok, that sounds scary.. haha..
