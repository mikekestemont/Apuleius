Sadie is doing much better now.  I took her back to the vet for a check yup.  Her ear is looking a lot better.  I'm going to have to put drops in her ears for another 2 days then one week off then another week of drops.  She was a lot better this time.  She didn't hiss or growl as much.  That made me feel better.
My Cat Sadie has a real bad ear infection.  Boy was she pissed at me when I had to wrap her up in a blanket so the vet could clean her ear.  She hissed and growled at me.  After I got her home I had to treat her to some good wet food.    Sadie is a great cat.  She talks a lot.  Sometimes too much.  I have to hold her like a baby for about 20 minutes after I get home or she yells at me for an hour.  I rescued her from the Feline Foundation a cool non-kill shelter.  She sleep behind my knees or right net to my belly under the covers.  She is a little heater.  The vet told me to use some drops in her ears for the next 4 days.  If ther is no improvement they will have to do sugery.  I hope it doesn't come to that.  I gave her some treats before I left back to work.
Well the boy called me last night and told me that he would be writing me an email.  Well I looked in my In box and there was no email.  I can say I'm a bit dissapointed.  I was really looking forward to reading he reply to my last email.  I'm just being overly emotional.  I guess I just want people to do what they say they are gonna do.  I'm just as guilty for not following thru too.  I guess I should work on that in my self before I start making comments about others.  I'm not wanting to go to work today.  I just wanna chill at home and veg on the couch.  But that is not healthy.  I hope he calls or writes to me sometime today.  Well time to get dressed and head to work....
Ahhhhhh I feel much better.  I got my house cleaned, got my laundry done.  I had 7 loads of laundry.  OMG it took so long.  It took almost 2 hours.  So I'm hoping to hear from this boy who is suppost to call me.  I hope he calls.  So now I'm just gonna relax at home.  Things are getting better, working through emotions.  Watching Millionaire.  It's kinda dumb..... Well I'm off.
Man what a day already, had a meeting with the county health department.  Lots of stuff going on.  I sit at my desk and think about where I was a year ago and where I am now.  I have my own place, I have a great job, I have great friends, I'm back in Fresno which is not bad but not good either.  I miss the City.  I miss the people there.  I sometimes t
