A love poem, one I have never been able to edit properly because it's for Charlie, a man who blindsided me.  You dear, My Scottish rogue my German aristocrat my sweet, international lover:  whisper your story in Gaelic and Greek, then blithely kiss me with your eyes closed, heart flung wide open.  Beneath a sanguine moon, I will show you the star that shines upon the hour of our meeting. _______________________  It is what it is, I suppose.

I'm turning into one of those people. You know the ones, the ones with nothing to talk about--ever!--except their kid. I could talk for hours about the cute things he does.

You could have soaked me up off the floor with one of those super-absorbent paper towels.  But really, how many people would find that little anecdote as amusing as I do? I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, how annoying are people like me? Is this just a natural consequence of having children? Two years ago I could have talked about current events, movies, books I was reading, pictures I was painting or drawing. The photos on this blog might have been of plants, or kittens, or tacky Christmas light displays.  Not that any of those things are terribly interesting...they're just, well, different. My life was different. It was all about me. But now, my driving purpose in this world is to raise Jack into a polite, helpful, kind, and intelligent man. A tall order, and a more interesting undertaking than anything I've done before--especially if you consider Jack as I do.  He arrived here with no expectations, no preconceived notions, no desires other than the basic human needs to eat and feel safe. A blank slate. Just fifteen months later, he can point his finger at me and say "no, no." He knows the cat says "meow" and the cow says "moo" (and he utters his "moos" with such feeling). He's developed preferences for mac n' cheese and Whatever Mommy Has In Her Cup.  So I guess what I'm saying is, yes, I'm probably annoying--but isn't he a
