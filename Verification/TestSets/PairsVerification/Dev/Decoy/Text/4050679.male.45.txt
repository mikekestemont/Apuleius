I had a wedding rehearsal tonight. The bride seemed fine all the way through the practice. Afterwards, though, she appeared to be nervous. I asked her about it and she confirmed my suspicions. "Why is that," I asked. "I'm afraid he will change." I thought for a moment and then nodded my head. "You're right, he will change ... but so will you. And if you want the marriage to continue to be what it is right now, you will need to change together. Keep the lines of communication open always!" She seemed a bit stunned that I would suggest, on the eve of her most happy moment, that it would not always be like this. But then agreed: the only thing unchanging is constant change.  After the practice, I thought about my marriage of 25 years. Oh, how different I am now than then. The sameis true with my wife, Kim. We've been through a bunchtogether, and it's not over yet. I still love her as much as the day we were wed. No, more than that. It's not the giddy, goose-pimpley love I remember. It's more of a deep, glowing ember love that contains the ever-present promise of passion; waiting for a breath to stir it to flame. I've come to be as comfortable with it as my own skin. But I never take it for granted. I'm sure it seems that way to Kim occasionally, for I'm not the most romantic guy in the world. (Actually, I'm probably not in the top 40%, a shameful admission).  Ahh, but who knows...maybe I'll change. The only constant is change, right?
When going by John's place, he reminded me of a great book I had to read for Summer classes this year. The name is   Codependent No More   by Melody Beatty. It was required for our pastoral care class to alert us to the dangers of emotional entanglements involved in pastoral care. But all of the students saw bits and pieces of themselves in the chapters. I suppose this brings out the societal nature of us humans; we are all codependent on each other to some degree.                    But as the chapters flew by, I saw little bits here and there that freed me up quite a bit. I am only responsible for my actions and no one else's. I may try to help here and there, but ultimately, the responsibility to change belongs to that person. And there is nothing you can do about it. As a pastor, my hope is to change the world in some way. What I realize now is that the world must want to change first. Oh, I'll be there offering to help (in my little corner if it) when it asks, but I can't force it. It's a hard concept for some to grasp, or at least it was for me. I'm one of those whose identity was wrapped up in helping everyone but me. It feels selfish sometimes, and just a little scary only being me. But there is also a great freedom that c
