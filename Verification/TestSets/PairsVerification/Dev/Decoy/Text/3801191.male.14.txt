Decided to switch to blogspot, after the constant breaking down of dland, and mei's constant advice...  So yea...sorry nic, but im makin the switch...  You'll notice something else about this blog...the title  So yea...heres goes my rant for today  MY MOM IS A BITCH!!!  Why am i sayin this? Simple...lets take a little walk back in time...to this afternoon  This Friday is St. John's day...and just so happens that i got chosen to be in the GOH marching contingent for the occassion.  Anyway, this year, our OTCs decided to break the tradition of camping over in school the night b4 SJAB day, however, on the condition that we checked in our uniforms to make sure that certain INDIVIDUALS *cough*sae chong*cough**cough* did not leave any part of the full uniform at home...which would spell doom for all of us. Anyway, we had to check the uniforms in today, and have em inspected by our CSM, Kailun, and as such, i told my mom that id be finishing a lil later. "Nvm," she sed..."ill just park down at the SJAB room and wait. Dun worry, take your time..."  Now, earlier on...when school let out, i rushed down to the SJAB room to book in my uniform. On my way down, hsien hui stopped me, and asked is i could help him chek his full u in as well (apparently...our dear chinese teacher *er hem**prepares chi-na accent* HWARNG LAU SHHI had asked him to finish up some admin stuff after school that day), so, fine, i told him id do it...  Now, here's where it all started. On my way to the SJAB room, i called my mom to tell her that i might take a lil while longer complete the booking in of the uniforms, and right after that, i thought i left my hp on...  About 20 mins after i stepped into the st john's room, i had finished the uniform inspection, and was just clearing up the paper bags and stuff i used to carry the uniforms in...when all of a sudden, my mom storms into the SJAB room and starts railing "SHERWIN TAY! HOW MUCH LONGER ARE U GOING TO TAKE!!! IVE GOT AN APOINTMENT AT 4 PM U KNOW???". I try to tell her that ill be finished as soon as im done clearing...but what happens? SHE WONT EVEN LET ME GET A SINGLE WORD IN EDGEWISE!!! So fine, i ask nikhil to help me clear it up, and i run off...watever happened to her words of "Dun worry, take your time..."?  Now, as soon as i jump into the car, my mom tells me, "WHY DIDNT U SWITCH ON YOUR HP!!!". I whip out my hp to discover that its off...  and so i go "Eh? I thought it was on...". Next thing i know, shes schitzing it, and yellin "U ALWAYS HAVE AN EXCUSE ONE, YOURE ALWAYS NOT WRONG",l and im like wtf? Next thing she goes "YOURE SO STUPID, EVEN THAT DOG OF YOURS IS SMARTER THAN YOU!!!". Im normally not one to waste time a
