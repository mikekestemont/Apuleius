a pregnancy and makes him feel guilty about stressing her out.   But don't worry. The whole fake pregnancy thing went smooth as silk, because after reconciling, they decide to move away to Texas, and along the way...oops! somebody's period shows up. Great excuse for a miscarriage. Phew! Perfect timing. Texas doesn't last long. A few weeks maybe before he assaults her again, they get kicked out of her family's house, and end up having to come back to Northern Virginia.  Flash forward a year or so...Stephanie's having a baby! For real this time. Only one problem...who is her baby's daddy? Could it be Robert? Maybe, because even though by this point they are no longer living together or considering themselves a couple, they still have special "benefits" with each other. Could it be Sandro? Her actual boyfriend of a few months and future husband? Could it be another one of the random guys she hooked up with one night while her and Sandro were fighting? Talk about a sticky situation. Lucky for her, Sandro, being the nice guy that he is, takes on the responsibility (keep in mind that Sandro has no clue about Stephanie's extra-curricular activities). Baby's almost here. They get married. Seems like a happy ending for all. Except for one thing. Baby Angelica looks stunningly like Robert, and his entire family for that matter. Hmmmm....Oh well.   Eventually, Stephanie convinces Sandro that they should raise their family in Texas. So they move. Baby number 2 comes. It's a boy. Followed by baby number 3. All seems well on the family-front, or at least on the surface it does. You see, a marriage and three children later, Stephanie still can't find adequate love from her husband, and has no other alternative but to find it in the arms of other men. Which according to her is completely his fault because "he cannot satisfy her physically or emotionally". So she finds a "regular". Sandro is clueless. "Mr. Regular" supposedly falls in love with Stephanie, and decides to show up at her house one night, knowing that she is married and living with her husband. Unfortunately, Stephanie's not home, and Sandro answers the door holding their newborn daughter. As you can imagine, he is quite curious why there is a guy at his door looking for his wife (who ironically is at that moment with another guy having dinner when she's supposed to be visiting family). And like most men, I would imagine, Sandro falls into the "alpha-male" syndrome, and in a few choice words makes it clear that "Mr. Regular" had better stay away from his wife. More words are exchanged. "Mr. Regular" pulls a gun from his waistline, and shoots Sandro, standing in his doorway holding his daughter.   A month had passed before I had heard the news about this incident. Thankfully, Sandro is ok and "Mr. Regular" is in jail.   I haven't heard much from that side of the world since then. Last I heard, Stephanie and Sandro were seeking marriage counseling to try work through her infidelity p
