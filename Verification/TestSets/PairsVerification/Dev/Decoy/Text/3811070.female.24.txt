It's 11:20 pm and I'm still awake.  Why?  Well I'm 34 weeks pregnant and I have heartburn that would drop a goat... and you know goats, they eat anything so imagine the heartburn goats must get.   I have 900 channels and there's nothing on television. Well, Will and Grace is on but that show is a little tired these days.  I miss Becker.  I'm surprised that what's-his-name was actaully pretty good in that show. Oh, shit I can't remember his name. I hate it when that happens, when I can't remember something that's right on the tip of my brain. Tom something. Tom? No. Watch, I'll remember in like a week and just blurt it out in the middle of a conversation and people will look at me funny like I'm some kind of autistic person with problems.   So I can't sleep because I can't get comfortable and my throat is on fire from whatever the hell causes that when you have heartburn. Plus I keep burping so Hubby has kicked me out of the bedroom and told me to sleep in the recliner. Well, fuck you very much. So maybe I can be kind and reciprocate when he snores loud enough to make the dog bark.  I don't know why but it seems like it's harder for me to get comfortable than anyone else, because I have to have the covers  just so , and my hair has to be in a certain way and the pillow has to be sufficiently fluffed to support my head but not so fat so as to cause me undue neck pain, and by the time I get all situated I end up having to go and piss (one of the 50 times I get up at night to go pee with this pregnancy. Talk about overkill.) which makes me have to do all of that all over again. It drives Hubby crazy cause the bed squeaks and it takes me all of 20 minutes to finally get comfortable enough to sleep. I read about people with OCD having "rituals" they have to go through, like how they have to line up food just so before they eat it, or how they have to turn a page in a book in exactly the right way or end up having to read the page all over again (I think that was in Miss America by Howard Stern.) and that got me thinking that maybe I have OCD because my bedtime ritual is about as annoying, but seemingly of total and utter importance to my having a good night's sleep.  That, and lately I'm obsessed with the doors in my house. I have to make sure  all the doors  are closed in my house, sometimes checking on them twice or three times, before I'm satisfied enough to leave the house. And I've become fastidious in my cleaning habits, and when things are out of whatever crazy ass order I need them to be in I go stark raving mad. Is this a pregnancy thing? I've a
