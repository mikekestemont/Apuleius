You ever wonder if your dreams mean anything? I do. Well, actually I believe that do mean something, maybe not all of them, but definitely some. The other night I had a dream that I was pregnant. It was strange, I could feel this hard bump in my lower abdomen. In the dream I was excited, and then scared. In the dream, I went around telling everyone that I was finally going to have a child of my own. So what does that mean? I'm only 25, and I don't think I'm ready for kids yet, although I hope in the few years to start a family of my own. I think it means my biological clock is definitely ticking. My husband agrees with this - we are trying to plan as carefully as we can. Although I don't think anyone is truly ready for parenthood. A good friend of mine just found out she was pregnant. After about a week of battling whether or not to keep the baby, she has made the decision to keep it. She is not married, but does have a boyfriend (the father). She's older than I am, by a couple years. She asked me what I thought and I told her that I know of one couple that did not keep theirs, and that was the right decision.

But as I once heard on the show "Sex in the City" Miranda is talking about a friend of theirs who got pregnant and her comment was "she's been lost to the MOTHERHOOD" - I thought it was a great comment actually. When you have friends that have kids and you don't - it just isn't the same anymore. You don't call them as much because then they have to find a babysitter. It's not just that, but my experience with new mothers is that they suddenly know everything because they have children. What's up with that? I can't stand that. I also went to a baby shower this weekend, and I hate baby showers. All anyone wants to do is talk about their kids, which is fine. But I don't have any! So I talk about my dog - she is my child. I guess it's a time in my life where some of us are crossing over into parenthood. I'm just not ready. My parents screwed me up enough, that I don't want to screw up another life - not until I can get my head on straight. My mother really wanted kids and so did my Dad, but when they divorced, it was like I was on my own and took care of my younger brother. I feel like his Mom sometimes more than just a sister, 'cause I helped raise him. No one was there for me when my parents d
