 I've been feeling kind of serious about the whole thing recently - and I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad. I'm feeling that I might need to protect myself again - maybe I'm just scared of falling too hard, or maybe it's just too late.  There was some consternation over the cost of the weekend trip to Tassie, and I kind of regret even having asked her now - it was supposed to be something fun, not something to worry about. I offerd to pay the immense fee of ... $180.. and copped the whole "independence" thing.   I'm not interested in sequestering her life - It's just nice to be able to .. i guess spoil people.  I guess time will tell - which is something I have plenty of right now.  I've been filling some new stupid analyst role for Service Delivery and System Support recently - cause there seems to be noone in IT who is capable of doing ANYTHING in a logical or ordered fashion. Must just be me. They have no style, no pizazz, no logic, so wtf are they doing ?!   Anyway - I'll just rip the shit out of all the problems for a few days, display my ultimate mastery of the universe, and then fuck right off and do something else.  Bit confused right now. The nexus is approaching fast - and again I feel powerless to control the outcome.  I'm hoping that the path of my life so far will continue it's upwards spiral through this point also. Otherwise I will have to learn to more actively shape my future, something I don't look forward to - meandering from success to success seems far easier, and more pleasing to the mind.  I told Anneliese about Shaney the other night when we caught up for dinner. She was, as expected, not amused - but I cannot blame her - as I would have been just as sad/confused/angry if she had told me that she had a new boyfriend. I imagine my initial response would be to want to hunt him down and kill him.  Today Anneliese rang me to apologise and wish me all the best - which meant an awful lot to me. She really has been my best friend through so much stuff, and I hope we can keep that going through the years...   It's moments like that when I wonder whether I haven't squandered the best thing that could have happened. Then there's other moments when I realise it was never meant to be.  Anyway - I also finally got my Sensis umbrella after two years or something. It's sad, it feels like a chapter of my life has really closed for good.  I think Shanny is feeling a little left out at the moment - cause he's acting a bit weird. But what can I do. I can't always exist for everyone else.  Must explain the rationale behind the "I don't exist" comment one of these days. It seems to have weirded Shaney right out.  .
