(HU)WHAAAATTTTTT????!!!!!!!  New account again.  Which is Good.  Nothing much really.  Back to training again.   Every morning before 7 am. Have to rush to our office, almost running. When I arrive, right after the entrance~  I would: Pause, turn around, face this computer. Type in my ID number, read "Login".  Type in my password.  Tap, tap, tap my foot. Wait for the system to register.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, head to the CR. As if almost running again.  My hair flapping behind me.  Look around for somebody I know.  Smile, smile, and yes, another smile. As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then I would: Pause, turn around, face the mirror. Comb my hair.  Dub on some lip gloss.  As if I'm in a REAL hurry.  Pretending to be late.  Then for the last time, I would: Pause, turn around, head back to the lobby. Pretending to be late, I'm honestly truly really not. I just walk fast as if I'm always in a rush. Because I just love pretending to be late.
Main Entry:  insomnia  Function: noun Etymology: Latin, from insomnis sleepless, from in- + somnus sleep -- more at SOMNOLENT : prolonged and usually abnormal inability to obtain adequate sleep  Yes, I don't know why. For the last few days it's so hard for me to get some sleep. I'm just super tired. I guess. I have been drained~ Emotionally. Intellectually. Physically. Socially. Spiritually.  This morning I went to take up EPT. The English Proficiency Test. It went out well. I hope. Then had a little chitchat with a not-so-close officemate. Nothing much really. Let's just say~ Damn. I can't keep my mouth shut. I was able to share things to him things that I shouldn't have.  Yeah. Stupid me. Really. When will I ever learn. Not to just trust anybody. Unless I got to KNOW them. I can't keep doing that you know? I just can't. That's my weakness. I easily trust people.  Oh well. I hope he's somebody that can be trusted. Let's just cross our fingers. Cross our toes. Do the yoga. Haha. Call a shrink.  Anyway~ Tonight, they will be having a night out at Camp Zitro. In celebration of? Our last day of work today? The End Of Life? Super super sad. I don't feel like going. Really. So I'd rather watch some movie. With Kristine. I don't care if it's just "Milan". Hehe~ I'll sleep. For all I care. Let me just do that. Or watch a horror movie. Scare the hellshit out of me. Yeah. For all I care. Let me just do that too.  ~That's all for now.
Yesterday I was so depressed and so so down. I had m
