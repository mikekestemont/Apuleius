The best time for me to write is when I'm driving in my car...if only I could.  That's become my thinking time...40 minutes each way, to work and back, gives me alot of time to ponder things.    There are those times, however, after a long day, I just don't want to think about anything important anymore.  That's when I pick up my phone to call a friend.  I think about escaping from my life for just a little while...a friendly chat, a connection with someone other than a chronically ill patient.  Downtime connection.  Driving home, today, I decided to chat, rather than think. I reached for my phone, running through a list of names; who do I want to chat with today?  My list, and my thoughts, went something like this...  Hmmm...I can call home - I wonder where the kids are?  I think Jon is working today...or was that yesterday?  I haven't seen him in days...this 16 year old stage always drives me crazy.  When he's not working, he's locked in his room, or he's at a friend's house.  They used to all hang out at our house...not anymore.  I wonder what changed?  I know Dave is working, he told me last night he wouldn't be able to help me with dinner tonight.    (I called and got the answering machine again.)  I wonder why I even try to contact them anymore?  Hmmm...I may have the evening to myself tonight.  I wonder if I'll ever get used to it?  Well, I've got plenty to do when I get home...  I'll just call Tara...she's probably working too. I'll leave her a message... I did reach Tara, and found myself babbling on about nothing in particular...nothing she was at all interested in.  I think I told her I'd "see her soon" 4 seperate times. It became obvious to me that I didn't really want to hang up, but I could tell she was just being polite.  I said my goodbyes and thought about how much I needed to contact someone who didn't "need" me, or think I only had a terribly boring parent-type conversation to share; someone I could just talk "nothing" to.  Then I thought about Dennis... No, I can't call him.  He probably doesn't understand one thing about me after the letter I wrote the other day. Maybe I never understood him. Perhaps I just created this beautiful romance to entertain myself for the past 3 years. Perhaps it was just to entertain him.    I think I've finally let go of Dennis, intellectually. I still love him. What's new?  It won't do any good to call him.  I don't want to see him.  I'll just fall into his arms again, we'll make incredible love, and then he'll turn a cold shoulder and push me away.  Again.  Except that one weekend.  What was it, a month ago?  What an incredible weekend that was!  I had been in Orlando at a Peak Potentials seminar.  He tried to get ahold of me every day. Now that was NOT like Dennis.  There were weeks a
