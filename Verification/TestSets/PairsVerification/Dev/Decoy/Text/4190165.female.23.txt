guilty about my fkatmates. I couldn't leave until i found someone to replace me but i think that's going to be really difficult. Amanda (my flatmate) said when Maddi (other flatmate) mentioned moving out that it would be ok because they found me when they needed to. I think they were just lucky tho. I can just see it being a nightmare, neither Tim or myself can afford to pay two rents but if I can't find someone I don't know what to do.    On a lighter note, i'm also dreading the actual move out/in. I live on the third floor and Tim and i would like to live on the first floor. All in all thats four flights of stairs to contend with. It was awful enough moving in and carrying all my stuff upstairs! I'm a girl therefore it goes without saying that i've got loads more stuff now than i did 7 months ago when i moved in! it's going to be such hard work moving out again!!      Also changing is my job. Tim and I are going to live in Petersfield. I live in Winchester currently therefore i would like to move jobs to be a bit closer. My contract in my job runs out in December, i'm sure they will extend it but I don't want to stay in this job much more than a year. I would like to work at EHDC, i wanted to even before i met Tim but jobs there aren't that easy to come by. It seems that a lot of people would like to work at EHDC!        What to do? what to do? the only things i'm certain about are that I love Tim, i don't want to live in a flat share situation anymore. I do like my flatmates but i want my things everywhere. I dont want to have to worry that i'm annoying someone by my things being around. i dont want to worry that my things are taking over and i dont want other peoples things that arent to my taste in my house. Not that either of them have bad taste but still thats how i feel.    Enough of this now, i am at work and maybe i ought to do some!   Tara for nowxx
If for some reason someone other than me or specified others is reading this i would like to redirect them to the excellent   urlLink   www.boinng.com     run by my excellent boyf!
This is my very first entry of a blog i intend to keep updating at least once a day.   I want someone i can write whatever i like and get things off my chest.    I'm tempted not to give the address to anyone and keep this entirely to myself but I'm a sociable person (or so i like to think) so I am going to give this address to a select few. Tbh, i think it's quite self centred of me to think that anyone would be interested in my life but anyway...   Anyway, first post done, hopefully the first of m
