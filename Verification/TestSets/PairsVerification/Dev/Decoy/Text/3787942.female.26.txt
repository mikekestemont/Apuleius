it's cool, flaix tv is playing lots of videos i like today. i wish they played more HIM, though. they used to, but now they don't anymore, even though lots of people request them. i wonder why!  i think my mocca frap made me kinda sick. i also wonder why!  speaking of wondering... i wonder where i've put my black eyed peas cd and the bellydancing flyer i found yesterday! this house has holes or something.  Yesterday i basically relaxed at home, since i wasn't working. i did some online stuff in the morning, then i worked out and watched stuff i had taped from tv. I also did some paper stuff with my dad, to get my tax money returned. not sure what it's called in english. i had to call my boss so she'd fax me a sheet i needed and stuff. kinda messy, but hey, i'm getting 52 euros returned, it's worth it! lol At night, my dad's friend from estonia came for dinner. he was leaving this morning to go back to his country. finally! lol This morning i went to the cosmetic testing place, got my 25 euros for the test i ended, and then i had to bring these tax papers to the bank or a specific tax office, and since today is the last day to do it my dad told me to expect to waste all morning, and that i had to go to the bank where my account is set and all. well, i went to another bank and i was done in exactly 2 minutes! haha I almost forgot: yesterday my cat received 2 parcels. she gets more mail than me! lol. one was a free cat food sample i ordered online a few months ago -she loved it- and the other was a free blanket from a cat food company -my cat looked at me as if saying "are you crazy? a blanket when it's so hot? i wanted more food!" lmao  this morning i felt invisible: i went to make a photocopy and the lady was serving people who came in *after* me! wtf? i said "hello, i'm here!" and she said "wait, it's only a minute!". yeah, a minute... and it will be a minute if you serve 5 more people, right? it's only a minute for me too!  then in the bus people were shoving me as if they didn't see me in the middle. wtf?
he finally left. my dad's estonian friend. mr.unbearable! lol. he stayed here for 3 months and he's going back to estonia tomorrow morning. he's not a bad man, but he just gets on my nerves with all his lip smacking when he speaks, and all these random words he repeats 4 or 5 times in a row in most sentences. besides the way he looks at me makes me unconfortable. *shivers* funny enough, his youngest daughter is adorable. i wish i had seen her for a longer time!  i should quit drinking alcohol for a few days now. i've been drinking a
