The single guy spent the weekend getting good and drunk...with little mike..we went to a strip club friday night where we proceeded to spend gross amounts of money on lap dances.  Little Mike fell in love with a blonde haired stripper named Fantasia...He professed his love and asked her to marry him.  She agreed and soon they will be married...date to come...
Since Ed is a cool as Jesus - and I am the age of Jesus (33 yesterday) having a blog will now make me as cool as Ed (since Ed is cool and Ed had a blog) ... simple logic really (also assuming you think Jesus is cool).  Now that I'm getting old(er) and am trying to regain my youth, by copying the actions of someone more than 10 years my junior, I don't know if having a blog will make me cool or if starting a blog at the ripe old age of Jesus will have a reverse affect and will actually make me even less cool than before? …Sort of like wearing a toupee or buying a sports car during a mid-life crisis…       (I never realized how much Ed looks like Jesus until this picture!
