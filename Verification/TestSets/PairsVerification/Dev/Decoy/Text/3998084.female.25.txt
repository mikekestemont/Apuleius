wrap her so she cant grow anymore. I want to keep her little, however that isnt going to work. She is so smart for a 2 yr old. I was told last week that she talks like a 5 yr old. Time has gone by so fast.&nbsp; Today my leg hasnt hurt a hell of a lot that too is a good thing. I have had a lot of things going through my head today everytime I turned around I heard Finger Eleven's song "One Thing" . That brought in to mind Peterson. I miss her so much. She was one of the greatest people I ever met. She had a awsome personality. Easy to get a long with. And willing to listen to me when haveing problems. I better stop cause i am gonna start cryin and I know Sargent will if she reads this. So if u do read this Christie--- Think of Kellogg, Jeff, and probly Beve. That will give u somethin to laugh at. What u have been told about the first two and what everyone would imagine how the third one is. You would know though. U love him honey. Dont deny it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mr and Mrs Beve!!!! LOL. I suppose that I should go for tonight and spent time with Mattie and Brent.
A little fore warning I am very scatter brained. My mind just jumps from on thing to another in no time. So here I go. My whole life seems like it is fucked up. I mean i get into a fight with my husband and he&nbsp; says that he's leaving. Then he doesnt know if he is or not. My family says that i can forget about them and everythin over there&nbsp;and&nbsp;i love my husband .My left femer was broke in three spots and they inserted a rod in my leg. and put three pins in it. Now two of the screws are bent and one of the breaks hasnt even started healing. Since that day my life has been so turned upside down it isnt even funny. Nothin i do makes anyone happy. I sometimes feel that things would be better if i had died in that accident. I know that is not right for me to say but is true. I feel like a burdon on everyone and cant take it anymore. To me the only one that would have affected i mean really affected is my two yr old daughter Madison. I love he so much. She is everything to me. I just cant stand things anymore cause everytime i turn around im fighting with someone else. If it isnt my husband ( who I love so much), it's my parents, and if not them it is my brothers.I am at my witts ends here. Like i said before not mattter what i do i cant please anyone. This accident has put such a strain on my marriage. We had only been married a few days shy of 3&nbsp; months when it happened. I suppose I better go check on M
