it should have been.           So....since I'm bored and have a lot of spare time, I made one of my own. So...my dear friends especially, if you're as bored as I am...try take it. I'm curious to see how well you know me. But...be warned. It's more difficult than the SATs, TOEFL, ACT, and AST combined. You may perhaps want to do some extensive research and cramming beforehand.           to take the "How Well Do You Know Annisa?" quiz, follow the link below:         urlLink   www.blendedlatte.friendtest.com

A friend of mine, (you know who you are baby) moved away to Bali a couple of days ago. To tell you the truth, when she left, or rather, when I saw her last, I wasn't really sad. This is odd because I'm normally really crap at saying goodbye, and yet here I am with one of my closest friends, and everything was hunky-dory. I figured that it was all due to the fact that she wasn't moving that far away, and I knew that it wasn't goodbye as in "goodbye FOREVER". Anyways, so there I was, about to go home, and I was  fine.  Everything was cool, calm, and under control. But then she sprung it on me. She told me that I was her best friend.  And that's when the emotions hit me like a bulldozer. You see, I don't think we've ever referred to each other like that. I knew that we were really tight, and I have always viewed her as my best friend, but I was never really sure if I was hers. This girl knows so many God damn people, and she has  so  many friends that she hangs out with that I didn't think that she would consider little old me her  best friend . I know I may sound kind of stupid here, but bear with me people.  So what did I do after she told me this? I pretended like I was still fine...like everything was still cool, calm, and under control. Then, in the car ride home, I thought about it a lot. Why did I suddenly feel like our relationship was even more special? Technically, everything was still the same. Did the simple word "best" abruptly mean that our friendship meant more? Did one tiny little word really make that much of a difference?  I don't know why I suddenly got all mushy that day. Maybe I was PMSing.  Anyways, last night I finished reading  Black Notice  by Patricia Cornwell. I read it in only about a day...I totally could not put it down. Apart from a really intriguing new murder case, the book also deals a lot with grief, as the main character's lover just died in the last book. It was the best book I've read in a long time (except for my own of course ha ha ha), which is saying a lot because I've read around six books in the past two months. But now I can't wait to go and buy the next book in the s
