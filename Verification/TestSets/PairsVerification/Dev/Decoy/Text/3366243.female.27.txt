not dead yet, nor will he be any time soon), and my brother and my sister being at each other's throats and my boss just being my boss - posting is the last thing on my mind.  It's fucked up how when one things goes bad, one piece of bad news - everything goes down hill from that moment on.  My father is sick, my family is falling apart, my mother is feeling helpless in the US and is trying her damned to have control over the situation but in the process is driving me nuts (I love her and thank her for trying I really do), money is short, someone who I have cared for  the longest time is getting a divorce - but wait - I never knew he was married, I can't seem to find a decent relationship and why - because I am a freak? crazy? not someone that anyone wants to be around right now? I don't care, nor do I want to put any efforts into anything that means me maybe being happy? All of the above perhaps...  Yes, some of you might be saying "things could be a hell of a lot worse" but in the last couple of years things have BEEN worse.  I cannot remember the last time I had a good year, actually, I can, the year my son was born!  Everything about him is awesome, the memories, the time spent with him, the whole picture.  I guess I AM lucky because he is what has been keeping me alive, going strong, and not allowing me to give up.  Anyway, this is just what happens when I think too much.  I love my life, I love my son and family, and even my career... I guess being the strong post is just getting to me and I need a post of my own, at least until I can catch my breath.
So my father spent 1 day and a half at the hospital and this is the verdict:  He has Lung Cancer, it has spread to his Liver and possibly more we will know for sure on the 18th.  He cannot get operated or whatever, only chemotherapy (sp?) to help prolong his life.  So, I am not a happy camper for obvious reasons however, he is so hopeful and optimistic that it makes me feel the same.    I don't have much more to say, just figured I would give an update.
