Ok so another day began and it ended mostly the same as every other day. Crap yet exciting in a way. I went to the movies with some friends (Including Dan) and we saw Shrek 2. It was ok, Dan was asking like a dork. Hehe...Yeah I stole his necklace and started scratching at my hand with it, then I used my nails and I ended up with red hands. It kind of hurt.....but I will deal with it. So anyway. Im really upset at the moment. They had my Gran's funeral and I didn't end up going. Im really upset and mad. How could they do that! She was my fricken Gran for gods sake! I had everything ready! How can people be so rude! Geez! Man! Im so bloomin mad! Well yeah. Im gonna go now, Im talking to Dan on the phone.  Bye for now, Bridget!
Hi...This is Bridget. I got into this blog thing off a friend. An online friend, who is really nice and funny. And he says he can create all these new and fantastic words. He can actually. But that really isn't important.  So...Today was an interesting day, I went shopping...every girls favourite sport. I brought...stuff...like clothes and stuff...and I met a friend there, a friend from primary school. Her name is Amber. She is cool. One of my besties. She has the cutest lil sis though! Omg! So so adorable!  Uhm yeah....My friend rang me today to...Amanda...She is organising going to the pictures tomorrow with a bunch of my friends (Daniel, Delon, Gemma, Rach, Amanda, Alice and myself) I think thats it. Im not sure. But yeah. One of them, Daniel. I really like him (I hope he doesn't read this). I really, REALLY like him. He is so sweet and caring, but he isn't a sissy. He is really cool. But he likes Amanda, a lot, and I have seen him go out wif 3 of my bestfriends and like 4 or 5 other girls. It kind of hurts, to see him hug them and kiss them when I love him so much, But I guess I will get over it, eventually, I hope.  Im actually kind of feeling crap, Nothing in my life seems to be going right, My gran died...and so did my uncle. Like a week after each other. So it sucks and they already had the funeral for my gran so I missed it! Im so mad at them! How could they do that! I had a poem to say and everything! It mad me so mad yet I was so upset and I still am!  Geez. Well I need to go. Im geting kind of sleepy and it's 11:25pm here. So yeah.  Signing out for now, B
