while she waits... while she waits for me!
my math result 10/16, so bad, because most of my friends got 14/16, and this result means not satisfied....
Score    Eine Woche gespielt : 5 gegen 3 für mich.
Van Helsing  I bought new Van Helsing DVD in Trödelmarkt in Paderborn.
Since last week I have a TV. Not new but old, as inheritance of one of my friend who leaves this city.   I am really happy for it because I can watch a lot of tv-series, films and some reality shows . It help to improve my German, but also took a lot of my time instead. Na ja, everything have both good and bad side isn't it ?
This article is taken from www.howstuffworks.com  If there is water in a heated container and the water is boiling (at 100°C or 212°F), the container will maintain a constant temperature. As soon as all of the liquid water has evaporated (all of the water is absorbed by the rice), the temperature inside the container immediately rises. The appliance has a thermostat that can detect when the temperature rises above 212°F in the container, and it turns itself off.
Mildew can grow fastly anywhere, in nature and also inside our house. In the nature, it has important task which is decomposing organism substance. But inside the house, high concentrate of mildew could be dangerous for our health, because of its poison. Mildew live in environment with high humidity. To avoid mildew we have to control the humidity inside the house always under 60%.  In winter, we can do 'crush ventilate' by open all windows and door very wide for short time (5-15 minutes). No sense to tilt the windows all the day. It will loose a lot of energy and the house would be very cold, but the chance of mildew growth would be bigger.
Today we did experiment on stochastic. It is quiet new for me since I never learn about it before. It deals with probability in random area. I didn`t understand completely about the experiment but I've got some idea of autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is simply convolution of two same signals (one of them is shifted) over its period. Autocorellation of sine signals will output cosine signal and autocorrelation of rectangle signals will result triangular signal.   One implementation we did is to find velocity (in rpm) of the machine with help of noise sound from machine that was recorded on casette. The signals are autocorrelated, and the output will have the same periode of the signal itself. With the period finally we can calculate the velocity of the machine.

www.dradio.de/wissenschaft interesting link ! you can read the news and hear it as well. check the right part of text, there you will find link to download the hear-text in mp3 format.
7 vc. 5 (cmiimw) :P
it is true ! instead of using ear, elephants can 'hear' infrasound under 15 Hz in distance until 40 km. more ? later ok ?
