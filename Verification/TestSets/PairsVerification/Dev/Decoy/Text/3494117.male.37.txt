[Blogger's note: This is my first blog posting ever, so I’m a little nervous about jumping in here. The subject of my first post is not a particularly controversial or “hot-button” issue - it concerns some of the the procedural arcana involved in conducting Presidential elections. But it’s a topic I feel strongly about, given its effect on the 2000 election... Consider this my way of testing the waters before attempting to tackle more contentious subject matter.]   Lots of people bemoan the entrenchment of the two-party system in national politics in the United States. The refrain is familiar: Democrats and Republicans, they’re all the same. [This writer does not happen to share this sentiment, but it’s out there.] The Democrat-Republican duopoly arguably has turned off millions of would-be voters from having any continuing interest in the political process. These are folks who would be engaged in public debate and participants in this democracy, if only they could rally behind a candidate who both inspired them to action,  and  actually stood some kind of chance of being elected.  Meanwhile, every emergence of any third-party candidate is met by either the Democrats or the Republicans (depending on the place occupied by the new candidate on the hopelessly one-dimensional left-right continuum) with charges of being a “spoiler.” The main effect of this extra player in the race, the argument goes, is merely to siphon votes from one of the candidates, splitting the voting bloc, and throwing the election to the other side. The outcome of the photo-finish 2000 election, in which several key states were decided by a margin much smaller than the Green Party’s share of the vote, lends credibility to this theory.  Sadly, the inherent design of our current electoral system seems destined to perpetuate the third-party dilemma. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: voters are afraid to “throw away” their votes on a third-party candidate with whom they strongly identify, but who doesn’t have a hope of actually being elected. That fear leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: in fact, the candidate does end up tanking. And, in a very close election – as the vivid example of 2000 illustrates – they end up tipping the balance of the election toward the opposing candidate who, while lacking a majority of the popular vote, at least has undivided support.  So, how can we give the “little guy” a real chance? And do it while preserving the true will of the majority of voters? It is actually possible, but it will require a change in the way elections are conducted. [It would certainly be an uphill battle to ever get these reforms implemented, but at least consider the proposals, and then decide for yourself.] The problem can be fixed without requiring any amendments to the U.S. Constitution – this is not a call to abolish the Electoral College or any other federally enshrined institutions, antiquated though they may be. It will, however, require changes at the state level, where the election is (actually, 50 separate elections are) conducted.  At the root of the problem i
