dont mean physical beauty. if you could only see it, you would not wonder what makes me a happy person, and it is not because of my tangible assets that i deem it so. it is deeper, more crucial than that. experience has taught me that my inner beauty can be exploited. some people drink up what they can not have. withdrawal symptoms have been... unpleasant.
i met jeffrey today. he smiled at me and keep on playing peek a boo with me as if i wouldnt notice him glance my way. Just to piss him off and to tell him i mind, I caught him in midstare and let him off scampering. People like Jeffrey make my day. They make all the pains worth it. Its like i could bear even more, when i should have given up up way before. and i guess jeffrey feels the same way. his kidneys are shot dead. he's pleasantly plump 7 year old smiling face belies the fact that he might not see his 1st decade. and here you see him running around and sticking out his tongue at you just because he can. how sad. i would want to tell you, but i would not know how it would end. but endings for cases like these are always unpleasant. people like him make worth living. if he knew i wonder how he would take it. if he knew, i wonder if he would still be happy. but i thank jeffrey. for giving me hope. when i have none. ignorance is bliss, i wish i didnt know, so i would be happy. but i do. such is the price of knowledge. if ignorance is bliss, doctors must be the most unhappy people of the world

I looked up from the chart and saw yellow eyes. why me? "You are healthy, and that beats lying in bed all day" I focused back on the chart. The kid was only 16. He's dying. and all i could think of was myself and not wanting to be myself. And here he was wishing he was me. i told him i would pray for him. i didnt have to tell him that i wrote in the chart the number of days he had left to live. i am becoming cold.
rather than spending your life watching movies, live your life that it would be a movie... i should rephrase t
