“ Di mana murid ini?”  I’m sure when my Add Maths teacher pointed to my seat today during the first period and asked the question, she will get this answer -->“absent”.   I was absent today. I caught a fever. That is the reason why I was absent. I stayed at home and take a good rest for a faster recovery. Haha.. In fact, I’ve an enjoyable time at home.  I watched the Band competition VCD that was distributed yesterday. Lastly, I knew how was the performance being carried out on that night by my own eyes. Since the competition, I just listen to others’ comments, now I can make the judgement myself. It wasn’t that terrible like what I think. It’s ok. However, many mistakes occurred when the formation was performed. The mistakes weren’t any minor mistakes that other people might not notice about, but they were the mistakes could be easily seen even though they were not professional.  I was very happy as I was off today. I haven’t done my Add Maths homework. I scared my teacher will scold me again ler.. Furthermore, I don’t feel like going to school too. Let’s see today’s timetable:  7:30am – 8:35am : Add Maths  8:35am – 9:45am : English  9:45am – 10:20am : EST  10:20am – 10:45am : Recess  10:45am – 11:55am : Chemistry  11:55am – 1:10pm : Chinese  Err… It wasn’t that fine to have all these subjects together in a day. =-(   When I wasn’t around in school today, will my classmate miss me? I hope they will. I think my seatmate will miss me a lot, I was told that she’ll feel very lonely if nobody is sitting beside her. It doesn’t mean that my presence carry great importance to her. Hehe.. And I know I’m not an important role in my class. Anyway, I’m happy with who I am. I know I might be important to somebody. =) like....... my parents
There were some small incidents happened in the library today. When I was studying with my friend (the one who sit beside me in class), my BM teacher who is also my library teacher advisor came near and teased us. How? She joked “Kedua-dua kamu sudah janji belajar bersama-sama di sini?” It sounded like we are dating in the library. Haha… Weren’t we? Erm.. yes, I think we were. We have dated each other to do some revision in the library this afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. Hahaha…   One of the library users fell asleep, Madam Foo (the librarian) wake up the girl but she was stared by other students. Anyhow, she was just too tired; it wasn’t her fault. I was tired too. Somehow I nearly fell asleep too. The number of the Library users has been increased since last 2 weeks when the opening hours have been extended from 3:30pm to 5:30pm   &nbsp;  ** Life's really tiring... =(
Today’s Man Loo’s (my classmate) birthday, she’s my class treasurer. I think she has a nice birthday today. During the first lesson, one of my school teacher send a
