a great sensation Till you get locked in an institution  Big price to pay for smoking pot But have no money its all I’ve got Who cares if it’s making my lungs rot I’d die if I’d have to stop
If only I could teach the sinners To be good folk again  If only I could preach to teens Not to loose their virginity And now matter how blue life would seem Everyone could turn to me  If only I could teach the world My beliefs and knowledge I know the world would be A better place for you and me Liveable and carefree If only…the world would listen to me  If I wiped out all religions So people all had the same faith There would be no more wars There would be no more death  If only all the sinners Would listen to my preaching They would be good folk again After some of my teaching   When thoughts of ending your life Races through your brain Simply talk to me And you’ll want to live again

Look around and you will see, There are people far worse off than you, Compared to their feelings you are so happy Even during times bluest of blue.   So the moral is simple and sadly true, There’s always someone with a worse life than you, So get to grips and face reality, Things will get better, wait and see.

That is so just like you, So unpredictable, I want you to know that, I think you’re despicable,  Don’t bother knocking,  On my front door Don’t wanna see your, Pathetic face no more.  You are shrouded, In secrets and lies, You live your sorry life, In hatred and disguise,  I don’t know what, Keeps you alive, But whatever it is, It’s making you strive,  I’m not your mother, And never will be, So don’t even bother, Come crawling back to m
