Man, there is nothing wrong with sleeping until 5:30, I wish  I  slept until 5:30 today, but noooo school got the better of me.  Oh well Friday I'll sleep till 5:30.  WOOT FOR GETTING YOUR WISDOM TEETH OUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE SCHOOL GETS OUT!   PS. My scalp is sun burned and it is ouchie!  PPS My lip has an ouchie on it! Like a gigundo blister or something on it!! =(
yea its 5:30 pm and i jes woke up...somethings wrong with me
Alright, I didnt post that at 9:26 am, it was definately 12:28 pm. This thing is messed Steve
If sleep is for the weak, then I must be the weakest person ever, because I slept from 5pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday, and then was still tired.  I dont know what time I went to bed on Saturday, but I think I woke up around 9:30? And then last night I went to bed at like 12:30 only to be dragged out of bed at 9:30-ish again. AND TRUST ME IF I DONT HAVE SCHOOL TODAY THIS DAY IS DEVOUTED TO SLEEP! Seriously, I think that should have nap time at school, like they did in like preschool and kindergarten, Im sure it would make alot of people happier, I know I would be.
i cant feel my legs...im goin to bed
