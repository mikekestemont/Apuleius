i wonder y i want to die, to c the look in my lover's eye. to cause them that much lost n pain, just to c how much i've gain'd. i'll look bak n see how much better, she made me.&nbsp;as i fade out of life, n my mind&nbsp;fails, my heart retires, n my soul expand out of morality, i feel her tear, not on my dead skin, but on my compassion that is the only thing still alive. i try to open my eyes,&nbsp;to c the thing i desperately need, n&nbsp;i will try, for the&nbsp;rest of my life... to c the face, thta signifies the everything pure n good, the man that i want to b, the things that r worth livnig for.&nbsp;how foolish of me to wonder something that was in&nbsp;b4 my eyes...yes...&nbsp;&nbsp;in the lifetime that i spent w/ that special person, but is my life so meaningless, to allow these pangs of trama? is the meaning so sacrid it is worth my life? does everyone find that something in their life, so destiny has it b found in ur last moments? so i'm&nbsp;wondering is... what would i say in my final breath?
