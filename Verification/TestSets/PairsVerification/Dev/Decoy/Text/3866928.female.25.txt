This is my response to the readings "Closing the Digital Divide and the Achievement Gap."   To what extent do you see the achievement gap and digital divide as an issue in your classroom?  My district is mostly higher-income families with good support.  My school is a focus school for middle schoolers learning English, so we have a variety of students with a variety  of background knowledge.  It is challenging to have students from so many different abilities within one classroom, but it also is of benefit when mentoring is incorporated into the curriculum.  In terms of achievement gaps, I see several examples of students performing high and performing low in all race groups.  The lowest-performing tend to be students who are new to the country and don't want to be here & don't want to learn English.  These students are very hard to motivate because they miss their home countries so much & want to fail so they can go back.  I find that the best way to motivate these students is to create a positive and joyful environment for them to work in...the laughter and joy is contagious and they will usually join in with the learning.  As a stereotype, I hear that the Asian & East-Indian students perform the highest...but I can think of several Hispanic and Hmong students who are high-achieving as well.  I guess, in this kind of community, race may have some bearing...but it is not a deciding factor.  In terms of digital divide...I ask my students at the beginning of each year if they have access to a computer for word processing and internet.  Out of my 180 students, I usually have 5-10 that don't have regular access.  So, my students are pretty wired up.  They are also pretty savvy, for the most part, when it comes to using computers.  Many of them have websites, blogs, and skills in Power Point, Flash, and other software.  The students that don't have access to computers are given first dibs on the computers during classtime, and are also given access after school when needed.  I have not had any issues with these students completing their work at school.  I worked at a high-poverty middle school and it is completely different from where I work now.  Most students had reading levels below the 4th grade level, there were a lot of gang problems, and it was rare to find students with internet access.  Needless to say, working there and working in Cupertino is like night and day.  Everyday was a struggle just to get kids to bring a pencil to class...now my students bring a whole pack of pencils.   How do you think your students compare with other students in the Bay Area in regard to these two issues?  From what I hear from other teachers (I'm not real familiar with other Bay Area schools), Cupertino is a great district with lots of support.  I feel very supported there and do see high achieving students.  So, I would have to say that my students are very competitive and a
