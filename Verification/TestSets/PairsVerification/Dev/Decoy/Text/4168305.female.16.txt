I haven't posted for four days, so thought I'd better write another entry before I stop alltogether.  I got a call today from a careers advisor at my school. Didn't catch most of what she said as I was tired, but she asked if I was coming back to sixth form and what subjects I was doing. She also asked if I was going to school to get my GCSE results. Dunno why she called... It was pointless really. Think I said "yes" to most of what she asked as I was tired, even though it was around 2pm...  I was just lying in bed day dreaming when she rang. She well fucked it up. I was thinking about Jamie, and how things will be when he moves here. He gets his A Level results this Thursday. Pretty sure he will have done fine, so not sure why he's worried. If he doesn't go to Leeds Met, he'll go to Sheffield. It's not that far...  I'm friends with Wendy now, though we apologised to each other online. She asked if I wanted to go to town this week, but I don't know if I can be arsed. There isn't really anything there to go for. I'd rather go do something like go-karting or paintballing... Or to a theme park. I sooooo wanna go on some rides.  I really really wanna go to Blackpool Pleasure Beach! And the London Dungeon! Grrr. My sister has said when she starts her new job, she'll save up and take me to Blackpool. Knowing her she'll drag me where she wants to go though - she's 23 by the way. Leanne and Wendy have also said they'll go with me, but Leanne won't go on trains... Don't think I'm getting a coach to Blackpool unless getting the train is really expensive.  Oooh that reminds me, they have a fair at Roundhay Park on Bonfire Night! Yay, can't wait. The rides aren't that good, but this year hopefully Jamie will be able to come. They have a really nice fireworks display. It's just getting there that's gonna be a problem. Maybe dad will drop us off... that's if it's not just me and Jamie alone. So may have to ask Wendy and Leanne to come.   Hmm, what else do I have to say? Ooh I can't wait to get my GCSE results. Dunno why, they're bound to be bad. Guess I just wanna see friends really. And I'm still hoping for an A* in ICT! Plus a few B's. Some C's. And two or three D's. Pleeeease don't give me anything lower. I'll feel so stupid because I know if I'd tried hard enough, I could've got all my results C's or higher.  Anyway thats about it for today...
Dad woke me up early today....  "AMY! Becky's here!"  What? Why's Becky here? I haven't seen her since our GCSE exams in May... When my sister commented on her looking pregnant.  Turns out that she came to tell me she's pregnant... She's only just found out. How coud s
