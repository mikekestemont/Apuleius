urlLink Pablo Picasso  was a 20th century painter who co-founded the movement of Cubism. Born in Malaga, Spain to an artistic family, Picasso was a prodigious child. His painted  urlLink First Communion  from the ages of 14 to 15. As a young man Picasso travelled several times to Paris, where he eventually dettled for over 50 years. The poverty and desperation of his early adulthood found expression in his Blue Period paintings, such as  urlLink La Vie  and  urlLink The Tragedy  (both 1903). By 1905, Picasso had met paramour Fernande Olivier and shifted to the warmer colors of his Rose Period, perhaps the most famous painting of which is that year's  urlLink Family of Saltimbanques . In 1907 he painted the famous  urlLink Les Demoiselles D'Avignon , and over the next years he developed, with Georges Braque, Cubism, first with somewhat stylized still lifes, such as 1909's  urlLink Carafe, Jug, and Fruit Bowl , and then with increasingly abstract works such as  urlLink Portrait of Ambroise Vollard  (1910) and  urlLink Landscape at Ceret  (1911). Picasso himself never painted any entirely abstract works, but there is no question that this first phase of Cubism (Analytic Cubism) paved the way for later abstract artists. In a sense, analytic cubism redefined conceptions of space as it relates to art. By 1913 or so, Picasso had moved on to what he called Synthetic Cubism, which generally involved more color and more straightforward depictions of objects than Analytic Cubism, as for example in  urlLink Guitar  (1913). Picasso had a fruitful career thereafter, working in other mediums and creating large scale works such as  urlLink Guernica  (1937) and  urlLink Night Fishing at Antibes  (1939). Generally, however, Picasso's Cubist period is considered to be the peak of his career, and Analytic Cubism in particular to be one of the most influential movements in 20th century art. It should be noted that Picasso was a complete jerk in his personal life.   urlLink Rene Descartes  was a philosopher and mathematician who invented the system of  urlLink Cartesian Coordinates . Prior to this innovation, algebra and geometry were seen as two generally separate branches of thought, and therefore Descartes is sometimes considered the father of analytic geometry. Descartes also formulated  urlLink Snell's Law of refraction  (leading me to wonder why it's not Descartes' Law of refraction). As a philosopher, Descartes expressed intense skepticism about all knowledge and the reliability of the senses. He is famous for his quote "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), which in his treatise  urlLink Principia Philosophiae  he claims is the first statement that cannot be doubted. From this statement and other deductions, Descartes claimed to prove the existence of a benevolent God and to some extent the reliability of the senses, although I think these arguments are generally thought to be less convincing than our man Thomas Aquinas' "proofs" of God's existence. Descartes' skepticism was influential in European philosophy, and helped to pave the way for  urlLink Continental Rationalism , which emphasized the primacy of reason and deduction over empiricism and the senses.
