Future is always ucertain. No one can predict it. Your birth star, astrologist, whoever it is, cannot know what will happen tomorrow. And someday, any one is able to do the same, I will die, beacuse there is no point in living any more. Even God wants us to lead a good life, and we will be judged on our activities; I believe.  When I started my primary education, I wished to be a singer. Then during my upper primary education, I thought I would be an astronut in the future. Then I got deeply interested in space science and attended many such programme. But now its a hobby for me to learn about space. During my pre-degree course, my parents wished I should be a physcian. But my mind said, I should go for B.Tech(Sepcialy Aerospace Engineering). But on the time of admission again my mind changed. I joined B.Tech Programme as Computer Science and Engineering Student.

See the turning points in my life. Who can predict my life? Its all decided by Almighty God. Not by astrologers and start signs. If the future is disclosed then its like we know when will we die and how. What is the point of insurance companies?(joke).
Now I am queued up infront of God, for the final judgement. Yes its my turn now. God asked me to close all my eyes. Slowly I began to see the my journey(its my life) in my mind. To my wonder I saw the footprints of a stranger following me, invisible. I asked God, "who is it?".The reply was soft, "its me son". I got angry, because I couldn't see the footprints in situations of crisis. I am alone. Then came the answer, "its not your footprint, its mine son". Then where is my footprints. Came the answer, "I was carrying you in my hand son".    'We are never a
