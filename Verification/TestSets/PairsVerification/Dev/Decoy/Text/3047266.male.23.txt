Revising my previous post:  I said that Marxism now has become a product. Scratch that. Marxism has always been and will always be a product. Also, it has  always  been about exploitation. No other idea created by mankind has caused more misery and destruction on this planet than Marxism. Nearly 100 million Russians were killed by Soviet communism. 100 million in less than a century!!! How can the human mind even fathom that? If the population of the Earth hasn't learned that mankind is fallen by now then they will never learn. There is no natural progression towards a strain of Marxism that will work. It will never,  ever  work. Redemption can only come from God, not from a political system. There is no such thing as a heaven on Earth forged by mankind. That is a ridiculous pipe dream. Yes, maybe a few individuals or families can make Marxism work, but for it to work on a worldwide level requires the elimination (either through murder or dehumanization) of everyone who can't make it work. Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. As a society we have brushed the horrors of communist Russia under the carpet and have tried to ignore it. That is damned foolish. Mysticism unbridled by reality and a belief that mankind is evolving into a society of superhuman beings is nothing more than a fuzzy dream. Nietzsche, Darwin and Marx. Those three may have never killed anybody with their own hands but they have killed millions with their pens. We must never forget that.
The other afternoon I was walking around CD Warehouse and I saw something unusual. They were selling a red Mao t-shirt. I kind of felt a light sickness and laughed a little bit. The idea of a t-shirt with Mao Tse Tung on the front is about as ironic as a Karl Marx lunch box. But that's what Marxism is these days. It's a product. It failed miserably as cultural and economical system years ago. Now it's a prepackaged way to influence people who don't think. Brutal dictators and murderers are pop culture icons and heroes to people who have no idea of their atrocities against mankind. It's kind of funny and sleazy at the same time that the people selling the Mao shirts are exploiting the free market to further communism. Capitalism is far from perfect (like Churchill said, democracy is the worst system of government except for all the other ones), but it incorporates free will. Yes mankind is fallen and freedom is still a very fragile thing. People can become slaves to consumerism but its always within their power to free themselves. Marxism and communism leave no room for free will. A utopian system will never work because man can never be perfect. Anyone who believes that man can live peacefully in an ideal utopian system has a rather naive and childish view of mankind. All forms of government are man-made creations and inherently faulty. That's why free-will is paramount. Yes, free-will allows for exploitation, mankind h
