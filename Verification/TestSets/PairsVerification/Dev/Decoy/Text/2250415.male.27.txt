2 Saturdays in a row that I've had the joy of climbing everyone's favorite volcano. Last Saturday Heather and I went up the Paradise side. Well that is to say we did about 4 miles of hiking on 2 trails. There was a ton of snow and some nice views. The hikes were moderate with some elevation but nothing horribly difficult.  Today, However I went with Brian, DJ and Steve. WoW!!! We did approximately 10 miles (maybe more) in about 5 hours. This may not be a lot for the experienced hiker (which I'm not), but for me it required a hot shower a 2 hour nap and an evening with my feet up. It was Brutal. I loved the hike up the mountain, but coming down my feet were killing me with about 3 miles left.   Normally, if I'm tired I'm going to take a breather and easily mosy down the mountain. However today DJ and Brian had to be at work by 5. So after coming up short of making Mystic Lake (we only had about a half mile to go too!) We decided that we had to turn back or make the fellas late. So after 3 hours of hiking up the mountain we needed to be back in 2. Fortunately we were headed down hill for most of the way.  We made it, and I'm glad I got pushed like I did it was a great workout, but I'm definitely feeling it this evening.  Anyway, I'm a officially a big hiking fan and intend to make more visits in the future.
urlLink News   Wow! That's awsome. I bet the little girl is really proud of her mom.
I'm in Memphis. It's the morning after Brad's wedding (my roommate in college), I'm sitting in the club section at Autozone park ( a very nice AAA baseball park) about 50 min. till first pitch. I've had a great weekend.  The Bachelor party was a blast 7 guys playing quarter poker till 3:30 in the morning. The guys were a lot of fun, we had barbeque at the rehersal dinner, which was preceeded by a lunch ar Rendevous (the best rib joint in memphis). And no there is no such thing as too much BBQ. It's fun to come back home and see old friends. But that wasn't why I was here.  Serving as the best man I had the privialdge to stand by one of my best friends and his bride to be as they made the most significant commitment a person can make to another person. I felt very priviladged. Blessed to have a friend that valued me enough to say I want you right here at one of the most significant moments in my life.  Theentire weekend I wanted badly to just serve them. To do whatever I could to make this day special for Brad and Hannah. Anyway, they are in Mexico now probably checking into thier hotel. I know they'll have a great marraige. And I pray that I get to stay in close contact with t
