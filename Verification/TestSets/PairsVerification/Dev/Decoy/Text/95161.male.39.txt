Lstening to the radio this morning as they discussed the killing of Damilola Taylor and the social issues that create children who don't care about anything. The talk swung around to the attitude of children today and the issue of punishment. As usual as far as the media is concerned there are only two sides, those who advocate physical punishments and those who are against this. The sides always seem to have the 'beat them - it never did me any harm' and opposing them the do-gooders 'there are other ways to punish them'. I find it slightly amusing that the do-gooders never seem to actually give details of these 'other ways'. I've worked with youth for 17 years now and I have found that the attitudes of the boys I've worked with has changed over the years. When I started boys were eager to get on with whatever activity was going on. They were respectful to their elders and obeyed instruction without any problem. Now, they don't want to do anything, are cheeky and only do what is asked of them under severe protest. This is not all boys, but a vast majority.  The attitude is not helped by parents who in the past attended events, provided transport and generally encouraged their youngsters. Now some, not all, are uninterested, they give no encouragement, we never see them. There is a distinct lack of commitment from the youngsters that is sponsered by the 'he didn't want to' attitude of parents. Discpline has been eroded in this country. The attitude of 'you can't make me' gives every boy a powerfull weapon to disrupt whenever and whatever he wants. I think it's about time the media showed there are more than two sides to this discussion. And the alternatives to physical punishment should be discussed not hinted at

The crowd round a workmates desk wasn't for some problem he was having with work. They were all playing 'Who want's to be a millionaire'. Unfortunately they seemed to stall long before reaching the magic million.
I'm currently attemping to read a specification for changes to the software project I manage. Somehow, forgetting to use a style for presentation can be overlooked when the content seems to be the random thoughts about the changes, written as they occurred to the writer with no attempt to organise or even remove duplicate thoughts. Venting my thoughts this way means that I don't have to have an argument with the writer (again) and then have him spend the next couple of months stabbing me in the back whenever he gets the chance. (Ha Ha - management seems to be onto him)  So far this blog has just been me pointing to the odd/interesting pages I've seen on the web but I'm finding that when reading other blogs the more interesting bits are the daily life and thoughts of the writers. The idea of writing about everyday life somehow seems daunting, after all who would want to read about my life.
