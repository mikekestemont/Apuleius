Baguio County Club. Here's a summary of our trip.  Day 1: Friday, July 30  Left Manila at around 8pm (after work). It just took us 5.5 hours to get there. Hardly slept coz Pao and Fred kept making  kulitan ! Finally got to Cat's place at around 2am after Pao and the others checked in Baguio County Club. When we got to Cat's, they were already freshened up... playing cards and drinking! Slept at around 4:30 am (coz of Kat V.'s kakulitan in the room). I was roomies with Kat and Nic.. Kat is so talkative!  Day 2: Saturday, July 31   Woke up at around 8:30 am and woke Kat and Nic up by opening the curtains! Hehe! Sayang kasi the day! Everyone started waking up coz of Kat's loud voice and we all started to dress up and prepare breakfast. The wonders of technology! Cooked scrambled eggs and hotdog using the microwave. It was a successful experiment! Everyone liked it ;) Ate lunch in a Mongolian restaurant and took some photos of the group. After, we went to BCC to meet up with the others and to order some food (raisin bread and cheese rolls) for pasalubong.   Decided to tour Session Road... some went with us and the boys went to Good Shepherd to buy pasalubong stuff. Tiring! Literally walked the whole strip!!! We also visited an ukay-ukay store... it was my first time to see one! Aliw! Super daming stuff and so cheap! We also went to SM... took some pics at the balcony of the mall. Nice view :) Went to mass at 6 at the Cathedral.   Before dinner, we first went to the Manor to take some pics... pose kung pose! The fog was so annoying! All the pics looked like we were walking on clouds! Nice effect though...  Had dinner at Sizzling Plate... yummy steak!!! Had garlic steak with java rice! We were all soooo hungry! Worth the wait!!! Went back to Cat's house, freashened up, had a few drinks, and slept at around 2 am. Was too tired!  Day 3: August 1  Started the day at aroung 10am! :) Went to Mine's View Park with the girls to buy last minute pasalubong for family and officemates. Had lunch after at the Country Club... salad lang coz I was too full from the white corn I ate in Mine's View. Took some pictures before we went back to Cat's place to fix our stuff for our trip back to Manila. Left Baguio at around 4pm and rode with the 1st batch (the others went to the Palengke and Good Shepherd to buy some stuff). Fun!!! Talked about  kabaduyan  stuff (no wonder! Kat and Miko were both there!) Had dinner in Pancake House (in Luisita), where we also met up with the others. Finally got home at around 12mn.  Hay! Super tiring but super FUN! I enjoyed everyone's company and the fresh and cold air of Baguio. Can't wait for our next out-of-town trip. As always, I'm sure it'll be so much fun :)  *Pics to f
