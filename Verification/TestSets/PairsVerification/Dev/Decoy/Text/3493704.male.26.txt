Nagarjuna’s Manmadhudu is an entertainer by all means. Nag has proved that he has a penchant for such genre of films and in the company of glamorous Sonali, the film is turning out to be a superhit. Though there are shades of Mel Gibson’s What Women Want, the thread has been reworked to suit the taste of the Telugu audience.   Abhiram (Nagarjuna) is a handsome middle-aged man who works as an executive in an advertising agency. He is a misogynist. When his uncle and the chairman of the company (Tanikella Bharani) appoint Haritha (Sonali Bendre) as an assistant manager, all hell breaks loose. He tries to make life miserable for her, which results in Haritha submitting her resignation. In a flashback Abhi’s uncle tells her about how Abhi became a women hater. He was in love with a girl Maheswari (Anshu) who spurned him in the last moment due to certain compulsions. Since then he hated women and now uncle wants Haritha to fall in love with him. What happens next and will Haritha be able to succeed in her mission form the rest of this hilarious comedy.   Though the story is wafer thin, the director has been able to package the film well with an innovative presentation. Nagarjuna and Sonali are excellent and have played their roles with conviction. The music of Devi Sri Prasad is hummable. The film is out to wallop some fun ‘n’ frolic.   Manmadhudu, whose counterpart in English mythology is Cupid, strikes his victims with arrows piercing their hearts thereby causing them to fall deeply in love(Like my friend Kishore does) Well, our Charmer of Charminar, Nag, fits the bill perfectly as Manmadhudu. Paired with lissom lass Sonali , he hopefully is bound to strike our hearts leaving behind indelible impressions of love and joy.
I realised that something was fishy in missed call info thru SMS service of hutch . Consequently, I’ve come up with the following modus-operandi that I believe that Hutch could have been employing to trick & charge unnecessarily from their customers.  1. The Base Station targets a cellphone at random, and so a person (lets call him/her as ’X’) trying to reach you is told that your phone is unavailable, even though you might have been available. 2. You receive the SMS that you’d missed call(s) in certain time duration. 3. You either delete the SMS and go on your way.... End of Story! But in case you reply to the SMS and get the information, chances are that you might call back X (and probably other people as well) too.  Statistically speaking, even if 5 out of 10 people respond to the SMS and 2 out of those 5 make a call back, HUTCH makes a very neat profit. For numbers sake, assuming that transmission of the SMS from the Base Station is as cheap as 20 paisa and calling back to ’X’ consumes a talktime of Rs. 10 on average, the profits from this shady gimmick would come out to be around 30 rupees (5*2.00 + 2*10.00 - 10*0.20 -
