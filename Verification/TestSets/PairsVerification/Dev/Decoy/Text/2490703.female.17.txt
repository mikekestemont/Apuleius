Friday, December 12, 2003    Hey, I guess it really has been a long time since the last time we talked. I haven't really been up to much lately. I'm starting indoor track this January. It sounded fun and I knew it would be a really good way to keep me in shape. I've been really injured from cross country, so much so that it kept me from running most of the cross country season. I have physical therapy for 6 weeks. It's not so bad, it just hurts a little sometimes. But I guess it's helping me out in the long run.   Jason and I broke up in the beginning of November because things weren't working out for us. He blamed the whole break up on me. It was really hard on Mr at first and I started doing stupid things like cut myself. He hated me for like two weeks. He even wanted to go out with some new chick a week after we broke up. I seriously was so depressed that I massively cut myself. I just couldn't take it. We were such good friends and then we weren't. I think I would have been okay if there hadn't been some new girl. That was the part that slapped me in the face. I thought that maybe he never loved me and he only wanted to stuff from me. But then like 3 weeks after we broke up, he told me that he missed talking to me. Then like the week of Thanksgiving I went over to his house and he and I were talking. He asked me why I cut myself and started to make fun of me. Then out of no where he told me he loved me and by then I had a new guy...Just joking we started unofficially going out again. Then recently we made it official. I promised him that I wouldn't cut anymore, and I haven't since then. It's been two and a half weeks since the last time I cut myself. I'm pretty proud. Unfortunately, there is a Mr. X...Ross. He's a real cutie and he's in a band. So is Jason, but Ross' band is so much better! :) He's a sophomore, but the hottest one there is! No joke. I'll find a picture of him for you.  Other than that I really haven't been up to much. I really don't even go to church anymore. I just stay home and sleep. I really don't know what's come over me. I just don't want to go. I think it's because all of the people at church don't even know I;m still alive, nor do they honestly care if I come or not. I guess feeling like I'm not wanted has an effect on you. I think things have really changed about me. I'm a totally different person, and in more of a good way than bad. Minus the whole church aspect.  Anyway, I'll talk to you later. I love you like a sister...I'll see you next week, can you believe i
