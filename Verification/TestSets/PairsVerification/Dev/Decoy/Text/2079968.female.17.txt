Does anyone give a crap about reading this?  ....  Heh. That's what I thought.
I've determined I take too many online quizzes and waste my time.  However, my proudest accomplishment of the day: actually mopping my bedroom floor.
The "How Funny Are You?" quiz results :-P    SATIRE: You love making fun of stuff. You probably have every issue of "Mad" and "Cracked" magazines. If you don't, you should. You could probably WRITE for thos publications. Nothing is funnier to you than taking a large serious and boring situation and twisting it into a wild and crazy scenario.     urlLink   How funny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Huh. Odd. The picture of John Cleese is funny though.
well.      My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I guess that's somewhat accurate.

How now, brown cow?  Oh, for those wondering, I was Mary Poppins for that church  halloween party thingy.  Story: found a funny hat at goodwill, a long black skirt...sanitized them both, and voila! Mary Poppins.  Well my original idea was Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady...but...  Anyway...andrew and i won the costume contest thingy (he was mr. bean) ...we got a bean bag chair thingy. also we had the goriest pumpkin :-P it was cool. it had guts coming out of its mouth and eye and top of its head. haha.  Problem: there was only one (chair, that is) :-P  Pictures are on the way as soon as they develop and i finish using my roll of film :-P (wait...other way around)  i realize i talk too much.
MY ARM HURTS!!!!!!  Went to the doctor...nothin' wrong...just stress/anxiety as far as my doctor can tell...we'll find out after my blood test comes back...  yeah...about that...i had a flu shot AND had a blood sample drawn in the same arm...i can't even type well...  The guy that took my blood...haha...he said: "I have 2 rules...ready? OK...first...don't throw up on me...second...don't pass out on me...if you decide to do either one...i'd rather you throw up on me than pass out...don't handle that well..."  anyways he forgot to tell me to unclench my fist...haha..so i was very tensed up...  and my left arm freakin' hurts.  the end.
