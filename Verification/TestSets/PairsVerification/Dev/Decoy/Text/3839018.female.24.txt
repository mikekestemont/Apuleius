With a sudden influx of unexplained health issues this year, combined with the new Cadillac health insurance plan at work, I've been sort of a lab rat this year, fairly whimsically getting stuff tested. Airborne allergies, various swabs, tinkering with my anxiety med, naturopathic investigation, ultrasounds for this and that (they charged me my deductible for that, but I would have had to have paid it anyway, so I'm glad it was applied toward something).&nbsp;Today I went for my annual girl junk, they asked if I wanted to check for STD's while I was there.&nbsp;I figured why not. Given how defensive I am of my emotions, I haven't exactly had any semblance of a sex life in Seattle. So it's really just for the quasi-pride of having proof that I'm completely ok. So paranoid of STD's I am, I even have a fairly elaborate fantasy about what I would do to a guy if he gave me one. It involves bondage and rubber bands.  It seems easy to become a hypochondriac given the right circumstances.   Up until about a year ago, I had a fairly serious phobia of doctors. I still feel siginificant panic if I have to go to a different type of doctor than I've been to before. But only the first time.  [I was also terrified of improv - I auditioned for Jet City a few weeks after I moved here just to find out what an improv audition was like. Cried hysterically before I left. Ridiculous. Nearly fell over crying I was so frightened. Whatever, I went, made it through it and met my friend the Divine Ms. Impala. I auditioned for UP, the oldest theatresports troupe in the US, last year as well. That wasn't as bad. But not as fun either. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was lethargic.]   Dentists, on the other hand, never had any problem whatsoever. Even when I went under to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth out, no nervousness at all. They administer the general via IV, you start counting backwards, feel a pins and needles sensation, and you just disappear for a while. While I was going out, the anaesthesiologist and the NP were talking about the Eskimos. (The CFL kicks ass. Doesn't take much American foobah to recognize that.) When&nbsp;I started to come to&nbsp;in recovery stuffed with cotton, on my side, the nurses were talking hockey. But for me there'd been no sense of the passage of time. It's not even like what happens in normal sleep. So all I could do was wonder why they were suddenly talking about the fuckin Oilers (I hate hockey), and where the anaesthesiologist had gone, and had I finished counting backwards from 100?&nbsp;Then you wake up more fully, they bring your mommy in, make you finish your IV, give you gingerale to get your blood sugar up, and send you on your merry bloodied way. My mom propped me up in the back seat of her car. She loves to find Dr. Laura on the radio. I frankly c
