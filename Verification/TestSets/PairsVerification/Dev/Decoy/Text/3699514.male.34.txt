Stevens,Rhenquist, and O'Conner to be likely choices for retirement.
Are you ready for some (crappy)football as Hank Williams says. The  urlLink UCLA football  squad begins fall practice August 11th. As I mentioned when I started this blog over two months ago, the Bruins should be hitting rock bottom this year hopefully. They just need to get it out of their system. Here's a preview by  urlLink collegefootballnews.com .
It's looking more and more like Kobe will be around to play for the Lakers this year and not in the Colorado penal league. I posted about this ruling from the judge about a week ago and now it looks like the accuser wants to get together with the DA to discuss dropping the case. It's about time. Now Kobe will have to deal with a civil lawsuit. Once the criminal suit is dropped, I'm guessing his lawyers will get together with the accusers lawyers and work out a settlement. You dodged a bullet Kobe. Now just get on with the business of bringing back LA another ring.
reinforcing the lack of bounce for the Kerry campaign.  urlLink Rasmussen  and  urlLink Marist  are showing the race tied. Again today Bush is trading higher in the futures market too. Something is definately happening now. I can sense it. For people that trade stocks or futures it's the same feeling you get when all your trading indicators are aligning and screaming at you to BUY or to go SHORT if your talking about John Kerry. I'd margin to the hilt right now and bet on Bush.
Take a look at this chart from  urlLink Iowa Electronic Markets . As you can see, Bush saw his low water mark on the first day of the Democratic Convention where he was trading at 49%. At the end of trading today, he was at 54%. I keep harping on it, but this is in my opinion the most accurate indicator of sentiment out there.   Over at  urlLink Intrade Presidential Futures , Bush is winning all the states that he won back in 2000 except for the state of New Hampshire. He is not winning any Gore states from 2000. Therefore if these numbers stand for the 2004 election, then Bush would win with 274 electoral votes. This is three more electoral votes than 2000 when Bush received just over the magical number and got 271 electoral votes. Thank you reapportionment.
but John Kerry has proved me wrong. I was just watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Morning Edition and their poll numbers taken after Kerry's speech show no bounce at all for Kerry with registered voters and a negative bounce(or thud!) with likely voters,OUCH! As soon as CNN posts the numbers of the poll on their website, I will link to it. Granted this is only one poll, but as I have been saying, the futures market is going to be the best indicator to watch from now until election day. What's going to be funny though is watching all the Kerry talking heads trying to spin the results of this new CNN p
