Hello? How cold is it where you are? My Chuck’s soaked though to my socks and I am running for shelter. Did today fall hard on you like it did on me? The sky opened up and my eyes started to itch I threw a brick at your fragile plate glass image I wish I knew you better Is there a sad song running through your fingers? Thank god for guitars and pens or we would both be dead I wonder if you will ever vacate my memory? Just long enough for me to find another tenant Someone who pays rent and makes me coffee Days are much longer since you left me and my stack of feelings here I’ll file them away and send good thoughts towards Ronkonkoma
Vacation       Shafts of light break my concentration Bright and hygienic  This must be what heaven must feel like to a tourist from hell I have never been so clear No jumbled thoughts No rabid fantasies Just truth Clarity and sunshine I am well That is foreign I guess I should apply for dual citizenship I am planning to spend a great deal of time here Misery will always be there if I ever want to go back
Fletcher   This weather makes me think of you It has been so long since I have said your name Subtle projections Break out the slide show Daydreams heavy but lucid Anticipation makes me giddy I remember harsh words veiled with soft kisses You said you lost the bag and the boys were yelling I helped you look for it Knowing that you had snorted it all Without sharing  Sweet and Vicious  the last place I saw you Such an appropriate name The bar ( we fought ) The bathroom ( we kissed ) The patio (w e hid)  Your hands on my hips all the while You whispered in my ear "Stop tempting me" I wanted you to be something I could depend on Like a beer or a sweater You were too drunk and sought after It was hard to tear myself away I had to Forgive me I cried and wished I hadn’t met you I didn't even say goodbye  Spring  street never looked so dim I never looked so broken The cab driver let me sit in front He stopped at a deli so I could get smokes He took pity on me and turned off the meter I swore I’d forget you I did until today I feasted on your photographs with my morning coffee So much time has passed I miss you I know I can handle you now My little boy from  Texas  You are so warm and hopeful I love how you called me "Darlin'" Perhaps I was too hasty Expecting too much I gave you up without thinking You never really harmed me You never let me down October is so far but I am charging through my days Your sleepy smile eclipses all that came and went I have learned so much I cannot wait to show y
