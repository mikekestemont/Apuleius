is finding out you don't have to work - so you go home and spend the day doing whatever you want to!!!!  I came home and cleaned - turned on Holly Cole Trio and cleaned (needed) - and then I submitted FOUR manuscripts to journals. That made me feel very good.   I lit incense, vaccumed, ....then bought ice cream after I mailed off the submissions...ate to much ice cream...but oh well.   I got a rejection letter from another journal in the mail today, but no matter. I will keep going!  I want to take this moment to thank Leonie from the MMB who seems to be a big fan of my blog - and I'm so thankful for the encouraging and loving words you leave for me in the comments section. Thank you!  Tomorrow starts orientation.   Oh, I should mention something curious: I've been having very good dreams lately. Yesterday I woke up from a dream where my book got published - and then I got the good news that my poem was accepted!  And last night, I dreamt I sang in "Les Miserables" which is a recurring situation in dreams for me. I rarely to never actually sucessfully sing in the dream. But last night, I did.   Things may be looking up, just as I'm moving forward.    Fin.
Woooooohoooooooooooo  It is SUCH a high to find out you're going to get published. I feel a bit foolish because I just sent a huge mass email out to all my friends telling them. It wasn't so much bragging, but wanting to share my good news. There's a difference.   The Southern Ocean Review accepted a poem of mine and it will appear in the October issue.   I am now an internationally published poet! The SOR is in New Zealand.   I was published in Canada - a personal essay - in 1996...or was it 1997?  Going to go enjoy my emotional riches...  Fin.
Don't you HATE it when you have things you want to do - like write and create and live - and instead you have to go GROCERY SHOPPING???  *sigh*  But Alex and I are up in loft. Alex is going through old boxes of memories because I'm creating a shadow box of pictures of us when we were little along with little items from that period. And I've been bugging him to look for stuff for a few weeks. He's making duck calls with a ... a... duck caller... and my cat is looking at him wide-eyed.   I feel lucky that Alex is willing to go through his history (which is hard sometimes) to make my creative and nostalgic side happy.   He made a good point: We are at different points, he is further away from his childhood than I am. And that makes our outlook on that childhood different. That makes sense...   I feel irritable and anxious today. My idea for today was for us to go sit by the lake and read. I was going to start "The Courage to Heal"...the bible for abuse survivors...but now I just feel...irritable a
