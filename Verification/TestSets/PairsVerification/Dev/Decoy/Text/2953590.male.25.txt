Monday morning.... Thoughts for the day: * How does one thrive in challenges? * What does it take to rise back from a defeat? * Do serious activities stop being fun and enjoyable at some stage? * How much is too much?
Ah.... my first post. Hope that blogging becomes a regular activity now. Sounds fun :)
Read lots of interesting articles/references on the web recently.  Mainly gnome related: * gnome 2.6 reviews ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) * State and future of gnome ( urlLink here ) * More on future outlook of Gnome ( urlLink here ) * Mono ( urlLink go mono! ) * debate on the language choice for the desktop
Weekend...  Was good. Saw 'Hum Tum' on Friday (took tickets in black after a long time, in fact so long that I don't remember when I did that last!) Was worth it. Good movie, great company :) Caught another movie ('Yuva') on Saturday. Proper  masaala  movie according to me. Gals swooning over Abhishek Bachchan all over the place.... Had a nice shower to end the day.... no not at my home, on the road. Its pouring in mid-summer at Bangalore. Lucky me.   Fedora & Gnome 2.6  RPM upgrades are not as smooth as I wish they were. I need to read up more on what the issues are with the same. Am reading an increasing the opinion on the mailing lists that a clean install is the best way to go with Fedora. I think I'll try that next time at home. (Fedora Core 2 ISO download is still not complete, so there is some time for that). For now, however, I'm stuck at office with all my MIME-associations lost after an RPM upgrade to Gnome 2.6. On the brighter side, I got to read the  urlLink shared-mime-info-spec  which is good reading, and which I would not have seen unless I encountered  urlLink these problems .  Meanwhile, a very heartening  urlLink post  on the mailing list which says I can continue to dual-boot after upgrade to FC2 without _any_ issues if I just take some care. I don't use XP so much these days, but my gaming is almost entirely on XP, and for that I can't remove it totally :)
This is my first post from BloGTK. It got a decent review  urlLink here  and so I wanted to try it out. My opinion: * The front-end is good (HIG compliant as far as I can make out). * Back-end seems to use XML RPC, while blogger is moving towards ATOM. So that may be an issue. Not right now, though. * There are shortcuts to edit HTML without writing the markup yourself. That's a plus. * The line feeds are not coming in the preview whenever I press an 'Enter'. If they don't show up in the final blog, then it'll be sad.  Lets see how this goes :)
Serendipity  Ah.... what a pleasant surprise to start my day. Read on PlanetGnome that blogger has new templates available. Came over to check out the same. Got a
