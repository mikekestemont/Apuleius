I love food.  This is apparent by how I eat and how I look.  I don't belive in eliminating anything in a person's diet.  This article is one of the more sensible ones I have read in quite some time.  One thing of note, people have not been following proper portion control.  Instead of eliminating something all together, why not take it in proper amounts?   urlLink MSNBC - Separating food facts from falsehoods

I don't agree with the early pull out of the Philippine contingent from Iraq. It sent the wrong message to the international community by letting insurgents (if you can call them just that) dictate government policy. However, this is just inane and petty.&nbsp; Big, leader of the free world is acting like a a big baby.   " You said you were my friend. You left me hanging there. I don't like you anymore. Pffft!

I wish my mom remembers to bring some home.  Jay Leno has been going to town about the news that the folks from Krispy Kreme are coming out with a drinkable version of the original glazed donut.

I don't know if this is going to start happening in the Philippines as well.  I like this shift better than the routine 8-5 or 9-6 since I don't run into traffic and I feel like I can get a lot more things done.  I just went to this 6-3 shift and it has been refreshing despite the fact that I need to sacrifice by going to sleep early.  The best things about a Monday 6 am shift: 1. No traffic on the road or on the elevators. 2. No one else is in the office yet so I can set up things the way I like them. 3. I can have a leisurely cup of hot cocoa (not much of a coffee-drinker) at my desk while I'm setting up. 4. The restrooms are clean. (^_^)   urlLink Eckberg: 'Early Riser' shift next trend?

I must say that this came as a shock.  Although if you think about it, it made sense that Jenson will go to the team that first trusted him with an F1 drive.  Everybody was wary then of a 20-year-old untested driver.  Look at him now.   urlLink Yahoo! Sport - Button makes Williams r
