Hi Everyone,  There's been some complaints, completely justified, that I've been a complete bitch for not keeping in touch with everyone back home in Australia. To be fair, I've been called a complete bitch for not keeping in touch with everyone in London! So here's my attempt to keep everyone informed with my hijinks and escapades in London in one place so I can concentrate on the little things in my emails to individuals.  What have I been up to, you ask. I am still working for that damn media monitoring company. I am trying really hard to move on, honest! Just been taken over by a bigger company so now's a good time to get the hell out of there. Working on a few job ideas, maybe even a complete career change..... So, excuse the stream of conciousness but I am going to put my career ideas out there and get some feedback as I can rely on you lot to tell me whether I am being an idiot or not!  When I was back in Brisbane in February I was talking about training to become a teacher. But when I did some work experience sitting in on a few classes I quickly realised that was a BAAAAD idea. I have a lot better handle on my temper than I did as a teenager (thanks Dad for repairing those walls I kicked in) but I don't think I'd be able to hold it for long in a London school. The kids here are horrible! Back home I wouldn't think twice before telling off some ten year old boy for littering but here you run a risk of getting stabbed. The schoolgirls dress in a cross between the chorus line of Moulin Rouge and Kylie Mole (that's going back a few years I know, but I am sure some of you remember her). And that's the nine year olds. Even if I lasted through a year of training, I certainly wouldn't last long on my own in a classroom!  So - any suggestions on what I should do? Several months back I was talking to my friend Graeme about what our ideal jobs would be if training and money and time was not a consideration. I've always had this secret idea of becoming a midwife, have thought about it for years but I didn't do science past year 10, even though I loved biology. To study midwifery back home I'd need good science marks.  But a few weeks later we were talking to another friend of ours, Mich, a nurse whose mother happens to be a midwife. Graeme mentioned to Mich that I'd been talking about being a midwife but had the whole science problem. Mich said that if I wanted to I could do a diploma over here, basically an apprenticeship, and only needed GSCE or Year 10 science, which I have. I looked at the courses on offer, and once I have been resident in the UK for three years the government will pay for my training, plus p
