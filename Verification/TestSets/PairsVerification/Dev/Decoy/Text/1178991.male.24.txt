urlLink Here  is a really great resource on PHP unit testing - apparently SimpleTest handles a bunch of the things that I was groping with HttpUnit for.
urlLink here  is a good article of JMeter I found.
I wasnt going to open up a new blog just for this, but I wanted to post a bunch of comments and ideas I have been having surrounding php and web development methodologies, more for collection of my thoughts as anything else.  This will also be a collection of links that I have found useful.  Right now I am reading through a bunch of books on test driven development and OO development recommended to me by  urlLink John Gray ,  and they are quite excellent.  Here are some of them :     urlLink Object-Oriented Thought Process  by Matt Weisfeld   urlLink Test Driven Development: By Example  by Kent Beck    urlLink Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture  by Martin Fowler   urlLink Peopleware : Productive Projects and Teams, 2nd Ed.  by Tom Demarco, Timothy Lister  The last one is especially interesting, particularly if you are a manager of any technical kind.  Also, here are a few software tools I am currently working with, or trying out :     urlLink JMeter  for stress testing   urlLink HttpUnit  for web unit testing   urlLink Simple Test  is a PHP unit testing / mock objects framework  Lastly, for you PHP developers out there that want to take a walk on the wild side,  urlLink Sitepoint.com  has the best advanced PHP forum out there by far, and  urlLink this post  is one of the best collections of useful resources I know of.  I encourage you to read each and every one of those links.  It will completely change the way you code.
The next meetup is coming up pretty soon - should there be anything we agree to talk about beforehand?  If people are all interested in something, maybe we could all prepare for the meetup a bit before we go, prepare questions or something.  Any takers?  What are we all interested in?
Just an update on some of the things I've been researching and involved in for the last few days.    For one, I just bought this book : urlLink HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS .  It looks great, I have been playing more and more with CSS, and I cant believe I didn't know about it (css) earlier.  I downloaded the  urlLink sample chapters , and they look like the best reference I've seen to a great resource.  I am all about layers these days, and presentation from content at that level just seems so clean.  If anyone has any sites that use CSS well, please post them here, so we can all reference them.       urlLink SitePoint  is one of the best examples, although not totally attractive.   urlLink Fedora  is a great example - they jumped in head first.   urlLink Apple  is another good one - although its only partially implemented    Another thing I got in a bit of a scuffle with this week was a debate on a module that is being proposed for P
