working on the editorial side of a magazine and is about to launch her own with 3 friends on Illustration. I will try and post some pictures but have not been too successful so far so.... watch this space!
Just to let you all know we have now exchanged contracts and will be moving to our grown up house on Tuesday 20th July.  599 Southleigh Rd Emsworth Hampshire PO10 7TE  01243 371283  Trying not to get too excited just in case, but I do find myself planning where all the furniture is going to go when I can't get to sleep! Usually fall asleep when it comes to the piano....conservatory or lounge??? Should have bought somewhere with a music room.  Bump is getting slowly bigger and I can feel it moving a bit more now, although I'm convinced it is a bit lazy as another Mum to be I met said hers was moving all the time. Ours will probably come out followed by sofa and TV.

urlLink    Peter's redone flat is really good, much attention has been given to little details. This is looking from the study area towards the kitchen and at the far end, the bedroom. The bathroom and lavatory are behind the grey area,  family weekend june 2004
This is the 6th time I have tried to publish this it always seems to disappear! We have just returned from a weekend with Peter &amp; Linda in Holland. We went to a concert at the Delft chamber music festival, visited some other Dutch towns and had some memorable meals. Peter makes his own pasta with his new toy - a pasta machine it was delicious. We love wandering along the canals sampling dutch life, boats, bikes and bridges etc. The weather was really really hot.

Today is Dylan's first day at the local elementary school.  The school runs an experimental year-round calendar so the first term begins in August.  We've recently got used to sleeping in a bit later so we set our alarm clock for the first time in several years to make sure we were ready in time. With a little flurry of activity, we were out of the house at 7.45 walking up to end of the road for the bus.  Dylan & I walked on ahead; I was anxious about missing the bus & quizzed Dylan about the name of his teacher and the number of his classroom. Amanda tagged behind and Grandma &amp; Grandpa Goodsell brought up the rear. The large yellow bus arrived a couple of minutes early & Dylan leapt on and ran to a seat halfway down, waving out of the window as the bus pulled away. Brody bawled at the unexpected departure of Dylan and we all walked back home.   As I drove off to work I looked at my watch,  8.05am, and felt a pang of anxiety as I imagined Dylan arriving at the large school. I'm sure he'll be O
