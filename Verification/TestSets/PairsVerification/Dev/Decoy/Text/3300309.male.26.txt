Water:  2000 litres of drinking/cooking&nbsp;water, &nbsp;2 cubic metres and 2000 kg&nbsp;(4400lbs, about a tenth of&nbsp;the load capacity). This is about&nbsp;5.5 litres a day for 6 people for 60 days. However, the ration would have to be less than that to allow for evaporation.&nbsp;Water pump and&nbsp;filtration system. Would work for drinking water in emergency, but mostly for pumping water from dirty sources for use in the truck and cleaning stuff. Input hose can be lowered from underneath the truck into an appropriate source.&nbsp;An historical thing might be to take weak beer instead of water for drinking, as it doesn't go bad?   Fuel:  300&nbsp;gallons of diesel - assuming the truck will get 10mpg, this is&nbsp;3000 miles of range (conservative estimate). Diesel would be available from lots of places for free for many years after a class 4 outbreak. Under floor fuel pumping &nbsp;system that will attach directly to the inlets of fuel tanks on forecourts. Extra Fuel tanks need to be military spec self sealing/armoured.   Food:  I am not sure how to&nbsp;work this out. Anyone got any ideas? Lots of Rice/dried veg&nbsp;and tins? And multivitamins? How much per person per day? hmmm.&nbsp; Food is bulky though, go for high calorie stuff? Special containers to keep it fresh.   Weapons:&nbsp;  8 12-bore&nbsp;pump action Mossberg&nbsp;marine (ie.&nbsp;weather resistant)&nbsp;shotguns with extended magazines. 500 rpg of&nbsp;00 buckshot. 500 rpg rifled slugs. Equipment to clean, service and repair the shotguns. Spare parts inc. 2 spare barrels per gun.   2 grenade launchers.&nbsp;100 frag grenades&nbsp;for anti human activity.&nbsp;200 phosphor grenades. Safer, non line of sight and longer range than a flame thrower!&nbsp;Equipment to clean, service and repair the launchers.   12&nbsp;Modifed swords - similar to Roman gladius, but with hand and a half (bastard sword)&nbsp;grip to allow a more powerful two handed swing if needed for quicker beheading of partially disabled Zombies.  12 Roman legionaire shields of the imperial rectangular design. Great for locking together and holding the Zombies while cutting them up.  12 Lightweight anti-Shark suits. These will offer bite protection better than any classical or medieval armor without being excessively heavy.   Truck modifications/weapons:  In addition to the armour etc.&nbsp;detailed in previous post.  Additional load carrying, "facilities"&nbsp;area above habitation - solar cells, wind turbine, batteries, heater and aircon&nbsp;(see below).&nbsp;  Train type cow catcher, but needs to be raiseable to give ground clearance. Sharp, extended edge shuld leave many immobilized zombies behind. Useful for pushing through a crowd.  Large side&nbsp;extendable blades, around 4.5ft off the ground. Good for clearing space for any following vehicles. Experimentation required but suggest 10ft long per side&nbsp;with wide blage for strength without thickness.  Run flat tyres if they can be obtained in these sizes.  Portholes with steel covers for shotguns&nbsp;on sides, front and back. These should not create a weakness in the armor if added like ship portholes.  Simple props should be lowerable to prevent the truck being rolled over.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Electrical &nbsp;Equipment:  Solar Cells for the roof with batteries. No need to have engine running while stopped, which is&nbsp;good because it is quiet.&nbsp;Looks like the lastest solar panels give the opportunity to generate up to 1.5kW on t
