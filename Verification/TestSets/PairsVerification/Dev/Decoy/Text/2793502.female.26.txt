or horror? eeep!), but it's cooking.  Whew!
I guess I'll get my more somber though out of the way first Last Friday, my friend Tyrice and I were talking about the upcoming first anniversary of Barry White's death, and lamenting the deaths of the artists who have passed more recently, namely Ray Charles. Me and my big mouth had to go and say, "Wow, this is so sad, this usually happens in groups, I wonder who's next?  Then we hear  urlLink this.  *sigh*  All I can say is Rest In Peace, Syreeta. I'm glad your body not on this earth suffering anymore.  That's all I have to say about that.
I haven't forgotten you. I've just been kinda busy and tossing around a lot of thoughts in my head. So much has happened this week, I don't know where to begin. I initally was going to just blog all these thoughts as a stream of consciousness, but I don't want to frustrate anyone,I wouldn't be able to read it my damn self, ha! Anyway, I'll be back to post them all in a few. I have a few things to do real quick. I just wanted to get my fingers warmed up here first :-)

Hell, I even named one of my links after an old Rick James song!  Let me take a moment here and dance to my all time favorite Rick James songs, "Cold Blooded"    My condolences go out to Rick's loves ones. To everyone else, don't be sad!   IT'S A CELEBRATION!

So yeah, anyway, I went and met my formerly-internet-now-real life acquaintence yesterday. I only stayed a short time because I'd already made plans with some family members. I wish I'd stayed longer because I had a great time! She and her children are dolls! I'mma call you , girl! LMAO!    The outing that I went to with my family was to the movies to go and see Spiderman 2. I fell asleep. Can you believe that?
