I personally don't have problems being friends w/anyone from any other schools, but when I tell people from my school that I have friends @ s.v. they flip out and say they hate them cuz they beat us at sports...and I'm like, uh...that's a stupid reason to hate them... and one kid told me people from s.v. are a bunch of crack-heads, but I honestly hope/don't think that any of you are that way! but... you know lol I'm just less biased than other people I guess...w/e  this summer...I'm working...and going to campraise like I have every year for the past 8 years. :) nothing too greatly exciting. oh, I'm getting my license too! that's exciting!
it's good you don't hate people from Seneca...this is new to me, do most people from other Western PA schools hate us???  now i know SV and NA have a history of rivalry, but i have a friend from NA... the only reason they have to hate us is cuz we kick some brass when it comes to band stuf ;P  as to include the rest of y'all... what are you doing this summer?
I go to Knoch...it's ok that u can't remember that cuz it's just a stupid ghetto school in the middle of nowhere. :D haha  don't worry tho, I don't hate ppl from Seneca Valley like most Knochers do. :)
hannah... i added you to my aol buddy list, we'll definitely have to talk sometime... we can share sob stories together... where do you go to school, obviously not seneca, but where, if you've already said that, i just don't remember... lol, sorry!
I dunno rachele, it's just...depressing...probly cuz I can relate to it or w/e...someone who hasn't been through any hard, heart-breaking thing would just read it as another name, but ...i dunno i guess it depresses me cuz i can relate to it...so...yeah.

How cool am I?  I just got home...at...uh...9:30...for the first time since I left for school this morning!  ...it sucks!  but...yeah...rachele, your new user name depresses me!! but it's also something I can very much relate to, sadly. :-(  hey aj, I'm hannah, I don't really go to your school so you don't haveta worry about tryin to figure out who i am. but um...yeah
it worked...yaaaay...  but anyways... i got stuck with the mellophone since i play the French horn and i was kinda forced into bein in Marching Band...  as for singing... i used to be able to... but now i just sing to myself, while i'm listening to the radio, and in front of people i know who won't make too much fun of me... oh and i guess i should say that i am what used to be rachele... and don't take the new name too personally, i chose it as my epithet in october :/
