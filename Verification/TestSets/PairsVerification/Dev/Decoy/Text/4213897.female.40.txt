Hello there I,     it's friday again!!!   i get to take my daughter to work today (she's 12 & she can take care of herself while i'm working...so, no problema...), also my boss is not in, the other big cheese is on vacation &amp; it's casual day too!  we get to hang out in the city after work ( which is an early day for me...i'm off by 4pm) so what better way to spend this day but with my daughter?!  Moms gotta get a break too once in a while, of course Dads too should be allowed to take their kids (not toddlers of course or babies unless the company offers back-up daycare, which is great)...We just don't get enough time to spend w/ our kids when we work full-time in an ofc., the weekends are just too short!, & before we know it they're off to high school &amp; dating & have no more time to spend w/ their cornball parents...boo hoo....anyway, if i can find a home-based business or some part-time career...that would be ideal!     anway, my daughter is rushing me...not nice), just wanted to jot down some of my to-do today:          1) try to work till about 3:30 or 4pm...keep my girl busy, she's gotta get on this computer & play some games.     2) after work, go to Chi-town - my daughter wants to go get a hair-styling/trim of her long, long hair.     3)  whle in Chi-town - get some dimsum snacks & bubble tea maybe.  buy some goodies for the folks at home...     4) go home, & hang-out w/ my little boy & my hubby.          (& the start of the weekend)  hooray!          ok, that's it, gotta sign off...guess what song is playing right this very second....     my fave - JT's "Fire & Rain"  -      (? could the day be moreperfect than this???)     ...."thought i'd see U one more time again?  JT asks, & i agree...i know i will see U one more time again...at least before my life expires (wow, here's the drama queen again :)          till then,  au revoir mon amour,
Good Morning I,     not much to say today. just been thinking that i should change my blog title...i mean if i were to write a book i wouldn't call it - "& the journey continues...", it's too cliche, over-used &amp; beaten down the road littered with wanna-ba-writers hung-over w/ their own self-worth & obsessive thoughts...oops, not referring to me of course. so, i was debating what is a perfect title for this journal>>>          1) my secret love affair (sounds great &amp; mysterious but corny at the same time...)     2) "Truth is stranger than fiction" - but this has been used a million times!     3) Who Am I? - is good, but too existentialist for those ordinary day--to-day musings...     4) "raison-d'etre" - cool, but i'm not even French!     5) voices in my head - this has a certain ring to it...i kinda like it, but now for the next step...          So, it's just one of those boring days, we all have lots of those...     not much t
