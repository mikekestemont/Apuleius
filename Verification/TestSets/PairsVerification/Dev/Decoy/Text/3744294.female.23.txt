i realized that everything i've posted so far is pretty bitter. i'm really not an angry person at all. i just happened to be in a bad mood. i sound like the total opposite of who i really am. not gonna apoligize, because i'm just being me. i just wanted to explain that i normally am a nice, friendly, happy (generally) person. everyone has their days :)
hmmm. went on a blind date last night. first time i've ever done that. it was... interesting. got a good meal out of it. sushi. yum. the guy is nice enough, but i'm not attracted to him AT ALL. seems to like me a bit, though. how do i tell him i'm not interested? i would love to know. just came home from a bbq at my parents house. luckily my dad is in california. it was mom, stel, max, and his girlfriend kim. if she married him, her name would be kim kimbrough! i think it's funny.  anyway, i'm just rambling. nothing important to say. saw farenheit 9/11 yesterday. it was amazing. i think everyone should see it, democratic or not. it was very powerful. i felt emotionaly drained when it was over. very proud of myself for not crying. was close a few times, but no tears (which is rare.) i guess that's it for now. if i think of anything revelent to say, i will be back.
well, i've noticed that a lot of people who blog here write like they are expecting someone to read what they have said. fuck that. i don't care whether or not anyone reads my thoughts. actually, i would probably be happier if no one did. others are writing like they know they already have an audience, and they really care what they think. i am writing for myself. so screw all of you pretecious assholes. sorry, i'm just annoyed in general right now. although, aqua teen hunger force is about to start, so i should be ok in a minute. funny show. carl's my favorite character. he cracks me up. so i'm gonna go watch this show and go to bed, cause i have to wake up at 8:15 for the 9th day in a row.... god that sucks.... so, good night my imaginary readers. sweet dreams if possible.
hahaha. that's all i have to say right now.
rain, rain, go away. come back another day..... i'm in the middle of a thunder storm, and it fits my mood perfectly. i'm bitchy, horny, depressed, and pmsing. sounds like fun, eh? missed out on a concert b/c i couldn't stop crying and didn't want to go into public b/c i felt fat. been wallowing in my misery all afternoon/night. and i have come to the conclusion that i have, indeed, had my first one night stand. if you have read my last post, i believe i mentioned a boy i slept with down the shore who had an HUGE cock. well, we have talked many times since then, on aim and through text messaging on our phones. but e
