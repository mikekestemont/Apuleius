sorry to those peeps who got hurt, touched badly, attacked and have violent reactions about my last blog..... it is just what i am thinking and those are my thoughts... im really sorry..... =(  forgive me?
this morning i woke up with enthusiasm because it would be rest time after classes. this morning, was kinda actually cool, we laughed a lot during science and THE was not that dreadful. GEM class was unusually enjoyable and cl was not that bad at all, if you dont count copying every book in the bible. but...... when sir (guinto) arrived, he was looking unusually gloomy. he said "class, alam nyo...nde parang masyado pang maaga, alam nyo na ba ung tunkol sa science teacher nyo? ung lilipat cya?" i thought, ok, he is telling us something we already knoe, but.... "kasi, naghahanap cla ng bagong adviser, iniisip ko na baka nde kakayanin ng bagong adviser ang section a kaya nagvolunteer ako, kaya" "siiiiiiiiiirr! wagggggggggggg! noooooooooooooo! *sniffles of some people*" "nde pa namn syur eh" seriously, tears were building up in my eyes (pero syempre, napigil ko pero i was really really sad), why of all teachers he was the one volunteering to go to section a, why was he volunteering in the first place, doesnt he love us? but ap time went by okay, we were left with the feeling of unsureness but we thought "uy, nde naman yun matutuloy eh" english time came by, the dismissal's usual rumble and shoutings of "ano uuwi mo""ano assignments""pano ung projets natin?" anyway, sir arrived with a happy face, so i thought to myself, "yes, nde sya aalis" but, why does he makes me guess wrongly, "uy guys, get ready with your new adviser sa monday ha!" "englisin ka non, englisin mo rin" "sir, bkt ka aalis, mas mahal ka namin kaysa sa kanila!"  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, our 1st year of high school with a very funny teacher and now, there he goes, saying byebye like the past 2 months never happened, deserting us to sir roldan, no offense sir roldan, leaving us without any going away ceremony, just leaving us....like that. sir please dont go....  sorry kng ung dialouges indi exact at kng maraming typos... ayaw ko na icheck eh   (this is adressed to the other people....asc pa ba kayo? no offense meant....)
i dont know why, but im starting to feel drowsy even at 4 in the afternoon. i dont do anything that is considered work but why do i feel like this.  this is one of those weeks that you would rather not go through. loads of projects were given and the homework is not a joke. you cant finish it in 20 minutes. last year, i am used in getting homework that would take you 10 minutes to accomplish, but this year, it is too much. it is like giving a person who works 24 hours a day another 2 hours to work... do you get me?  anyway, another sad thing is, sir romero our science teacher will leave us and will go to another dept. he e
