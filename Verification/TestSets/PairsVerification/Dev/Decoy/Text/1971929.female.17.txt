Well, after careful consideration, I've realized that I would be too disturbed by the thought of going out with Jared. I mean... not disturbed exactly, but it wouldn't be right. Of course, I will try my best to move on. So far no one knows about the break-up excluding my mother, best friend Talley, and whoever Lucas told. I at least know he told his mother and his sister Rachel overheard. Anyway, I'm still uber upset. I'm not sure how long it will take for me to get over it. Oh well, it's in the works.
I've done some thinking, and I've decided that if I were to have a rebound relationship, it would have to be with Lucas's best friend, Jared. I mean, I'm pretty good friends with Jared, we talk all the time, and it would really make Lucas mad. The only problem would be getting Jared to go along with my master plan. See, the thing about Jared being Lucas's best friend, is that he's his best friend, so the chances of him betraying Lucas are slim to none. On the other hand, it is Summer, and Jared just might be bored enough; maybe even desperate enough to try escape such boredom by way of my plan. So Operation Jealousy has commenced, though the odds of success are lingering. If all else fails, I'll just hook up with some random guy from the beach or something. I think June will be dedicated to Operation Jealousy or "OJ" as I have decided to call it. Bring on the envy.
Well, well, well. It seems that I, Julie, have been, for the first time, dumped. I'm really kind of shocked here. I mean, I saw it coming, but then again I didn't. So here's what happened: School let out on Thursday of this week. I didn't see or hear from Lucas at all that day, or Friday, or Saturday, until I finally decided to break down and call him. I had talked to his best friend, Jared, about the possibility of Lucas breaking up with me and Jared said (this is a direct quote) "I can tell you with 100% accuracy as his best friend that he wouldnt do that". Well thank you, you dirty liar. When I called Lucas I used the premise that I wanted him to help pass out programs at the graduation with NHS. (I'm an officer, by the way, so it would make sense that I would try to recruit people for this.) He said he would help me and when we hung up, for the first time ever, he didn't say that he loved me. Now I was a little confused. After he came to pick me up, 15 minutes late might I add, we started on our way there and again, for the first time ever, he didn't hold my hand as we were driving along. Obviously, something was up, so I asked him if it would be alright if we just didn't go and he felt that would be fine. As we started b
