would be much more happy. But what I really want is to someday dip below the 200 pound mark. I haven't seen that number on the scale since high school, and even then I think I was just over 200 pounds. This is the ultimate long term goal. Not my goal for the next year. By this time next year I want to achieve numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.  I have other fears too. I have a real unhealthy attitude about being fat. Something that I’m afraid I will put on Chloe if I don’t get this straitened out now. Even now my thoughts are not good. When Chloe was born she weighed 8 pounds on the nose. A very healthy weight, although she was born 3 weeks early. She dropped down to 7 pounds because I was not producing enough milk for her so we had to start supplementing her with formula. She has really plumped up now. In the beginning the Doctors were worried about her loosing too much weight after birth, now she is in the 90th percentile for her weight. Am I already raising an overweight child? What can I do to keep this from happening? What is causing her to bloom so fast? Are there too many calories in my breast milk? Lord help her if she is going to be pre disposed to being fat because I am. I don’t ever want to starve her, but I don’t want her topping out the charts for weight in children her age. So, I need to educate myself. I need to learn how to be healthy and raise Chloe to be healthy. I over indulge way too much. My husband does too. I don’t want Chloe to be a slave to food. Food is supposed to be a necessity, fuel for our engine. I hate that one of the first things my husband does when he comes home from work in the early afternoon is ask me what I want to do for dinner. Why does this have to be decided 4 or 5 hours before we are going to eat? Why is this one of the first things on his mind? What’s for dinner? Eat, eat, eat. Stop, stop, stop! Every other thought is about what food is going into our mouth. Food is ruling my life and I want it to stop. Food should be an afterthought. “Oh, my stomach is growling, I should eat something.” I couldn’t even tell you the last time my stomach growled. Except when it growls because I’ve eaten too much crap and it causes me to have gas and I have to spend 5 minutes on the pot because my body has created so much waist from all the crap I have fed it. How do I learn to change my way of thinking? How do I avoid creating a food monster in my daughter? I don’t want her to be everything I wasn’t, I want to be everything I wasn’t. I’m only 33 for Gods s
