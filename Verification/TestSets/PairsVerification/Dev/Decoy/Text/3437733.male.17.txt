better shouting anyway.    dont tell me what to fucking do. i do what i damn well want. you dont leave me alone out in the cold for all my life and now when you finally realise your mistakes you want to take control again. its too late. its over. ive lived my life on my own. this shell, this living space is just a hostel. home is fantasy. home has always been my own soul where i found solace in myself and the beautiful things in life around me. you dont and wont ever tell me what to do. cos when i was helpless and needed you most you were never there.     alone in a crowd. i wish i wasnt a shadow. dont walk right through me.
you think you know me. you'd be surprised.  facades run wild. you'd better fear who i am inside.   i never show my true self though. so i guess its alright.   but never forget. im a very.   very.   dark person inside.         and if i show my true self. thats when i draw first blood.           so it begins.
I wish it didn't hurt,    hurt like this   To say these things to you.   I'll sacrifice   one moment    for one truth.   If we get through    tomorrow    then we'll be fine.   We'll wait for    forever    and see how close we get.   It's just another day,   &nbsp;one more chance   to get this right.   I'll sacrifice    forever    please just for tonight.   If we get through    tomorrow    then we'll be fine.   We'll wait for   &nbsp;forever    and see how close we get.   The worst is over for now.   Take a breath    now let it out.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  stupid. is me.   75 days.
distractions distractions. love is a stupid mechanism meant to give humans a sense of happiness and fabricate dreams out of meaningless happenings in reality. tsk tsk. cynical me. aint my fault. typical.   so i screwed my mid years. and i'm a fuckin 7 pointer. so what's new. failure after failure...that's just me. i'll bounce back of course...but once you're in too deep how far can you actually rise up to the occasion again? it's that sickening feeling of having to look back on how much has come and gone and you're failing everything you live for. especially since its me. the one. i live for myself. this residence is a hostel. this people who brought me up dont look like parents in my eyes. this life i have is mine to make or break it.   better stuff. nyjc gig rocked. frenetic. simply frenetic energy everytime i pick up those sticks and let loose on the drums. i think we did great even though we got screwed due to audio technicalities...screw the juxtaposition of 'advancements' and 'technology'. im gonna make it big somehow. someday.      ripoff. live the dream.
i have no life.
everything that has happened recently has been utterly confusing.   can't say that i've strayed from the norm. nope, nothing interesting happening here.    so why am i posting? cos i can. and that's a powerful realisation. yeah like whatever. sounds stupid. but.    [dead p
