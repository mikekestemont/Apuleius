of Boss. Like last night 2 co-workers and me walked in 10 min before closing and talked with Anna about the transfer and stuff. And then we to home $30 in food for free. And cause Anna leaving at least half of the employees are leaving as well. So with all this going on I’m thinking about how I should quit. Last week a co-worker just started to cuss out the manager. And started to make threats on the place like “I’m going to BLOW THIS PLACE UP.” And stuff like that. And I wouldn’t doubt if he didn’t. Cause he would do that. So im thinking about doing something similar like that without the threats and swearing. I’m thinking about getting into a huge fight with my co-work. Of course we will plan this cause he’s quiting to. So we are just going to start slugging it out in the lobby. And if have an idea make a comment about it.

Its about 11:30 at night and im in bed a few seconds from sleep. when my younger brother runs in hits my legs and says "HEY TYLER WANT A SMOKE?". I turn and look at him and all i see is a Pak of Marlboro Light. A pak of 20 class A filtered Cigarettes. Surgeon General's Warning: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. That just sound more like useless facts than a warning. So then right after the rude awakening i say "YOU IDIOT. You know i dont smoke after 11:00." So then later that night again im awakened by a sound that was like someone eating chips. This time i just look over and i could of sworn that i saw my brother eating a bag of chips. Then 6:45 rolls around and it time to get ready for work. So i get to work where i tell my co-workers about this. Im not sure at this point if it was all a dream or what. So im still puzzled by this. Until a few min ago when i go into my brothers room to find a pak of cigarettes. So then it all clicks. Matt must smoke now. So im trying to bum a few smoke from him. But it not going to work. Turns out that was a 18th Birthday gift from some of his c
