Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a genetically inherited disorder which causes congenital blindness or very severe visual impairment. The genes causing LCA are many, each involving different physiological processes, but all concerning the retina's photoreceptors, or the retinal pigment epithelium. Vision in LCA ranges from total blindness to low vision. It is generally diagnosed in the first few months of life. Currently 6 genes responsible for LCA have been identified, and researchers think at least as many are there to be discovered.  In some forms of LCA, the retinas don't develop correctly; in others, the photoreceptors gradually degenerate; in other types the retina remains intact, photoreceptors are healthy but don't function properly ( urlLink Koenekoop 2004 ).  THE FUTURE: LCA MAY BE TREATED!  LCA is the most severe form of congenital blindness, yet recent studies have demonstrated that it may be one of those conditions amenable for treatment. Since it usually only affects the outer layers of the person's retinas, and the rest of the visual pathway seems to remain intact, even in adult subjects, vision may be restored - at least in selected LCA patients.  Possible future treatments include:  1. GENE THERAPY: in simple terms - I'm not a doctor! - gene therapy aims at replacing a person's faulty gene with a healthy one. The genetic material is introduced into the body by means of a virus (a good virus), which once in the body starts to replicate and spreads the good genes to the target cells. In 2001, researchers at Cornell University restored vision in dogs affected by a form of LCA caused by a mutation in the RPE65 gene ( urlLink Acland 2001 ). This proved that gene therapy does work for at least one form of LCA. Clinical trials on humans carrying the RPE65 mutation are planned for as early as 2005. If gene therapy proves successful it is very likely that it can be extended to patients carrying different LCA mutations.  urlLink Click here  to view a recent, very clear and comprehensive explanation of gene therapy and its prospects for LCA and other retinal diseases, by the Foundation Fighting Blindness.  2. RETINAL CELL TRANSPLANTATION: since LCA affects the photoreceptors of the retina (rods and cones, cells which transform light into visual impulses) or the retinal pigment epithelium (the outermost layer of the retina which is essential for photoreceptor nourishment and maintenance) usually leaving the rest of the visual pathway intact, vision may be restored by replacing the faulty cells with healthy ones, from healthy donors or stem cells. Various trials on animal models have shown that transplanted cells do survive indefinitely, and that to a certain extent they form synapses (they build a contact) with the rest of the retina. Researchers now have to find ways to improve synapses, which will allow the brain to receive clear information from the retina. This is challenging, but very thrilling, as such a procedure has the potential to restore vision to a blind eye affected by most retinal diseases.  3.
