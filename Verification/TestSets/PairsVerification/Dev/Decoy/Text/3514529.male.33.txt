fulfilled than in those times. Unlike people a house cannot choose who occupies it, though like a dog and its owner there can be obvious cases of a bad partnership. I'd like to think we had a good one.   I live in London now, trying to make my way in the world, and until recently its been a struggle. I made the decision to move over here after my father died from a heart attack. The dynamics of my family had changed in the most tragic circumstances, and the life force of the house had been altered forever. I missed the house and my family terribly, especially my father. Within the next two years I lost three of my best friends, two to suicide and one to a motorbike accident. Ireland, my home, had ceased to be a refuge and had become a tomstone bearing the inscription: "Here lies the memories of 4 lost souls who left before their time." My family have worried about how I would handle it. My sister especially, with whom I share the most striking characteristics, is wary of my mental health, and conscious of my enormous loss.   I 've recently returned from a weekend with my near and extended family in Ireland, though not at our house. We were in Glandore, a beautiful part of West Cork, hidden way in the slopes and fingers of stunning coastline. I remember from art college the splashing and daubing of paint onto canvas in the most random fashion, a dash here, a bold stoke there, a dynamic sweep here, and sprinkle of colour there. West Cork is like that, nature's palette, where you round a corner or climb a hill to find something completely unexpected, yet beautiful. I woke up in my bed at dawn and saw the sea. It was the first time in a long time it felt good to be home, and though not my family home, it was a start. I saw my niece, who is 1, and remembered that life needs to go on, but in the right way.  So, I have decided its time to shed the weight I have been carrying for so long. Feeling sorry for myself is understandable but it has stunted my growth and dented my character. I am 33 now and bear the obvious signs of somebody who hasn't taken the greatest care of myself, thrown from one catastrophy to another, seeking solice in some of the less savoury of London's offerings. That time is over now. I want to make the most of my life, and perhaps begin to fulfill the potential my father and my friends saw in me, and maybe, some time in the future, go home to the old house and say hello to the ghost. As I've been writing I've been remembering a lot of good times too, so it won't always be so dreary.   It'll be a long road with its share of twists and turns, but I'll write it all down so you can walk a while if you w
