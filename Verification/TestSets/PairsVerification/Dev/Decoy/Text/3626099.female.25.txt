one of my favorite Red Sox players of the past. Aka Psycho. I love him, really. He'll never be in the Hall of Fame, but he was funny,  he loved the game and he played hard. He's a sportscaster now and I'm really glad he's still in baseball. I'm currently reading his book,  urlLink Pyschoanalysis  and it's great.  But why must he be wearing a mullet on the back cover of the book? He looks like such a massive dork! Sigh. When I'm riding MUNI to work in the morning, I worry that people see this and wonder what kind of white-trash shenanery I'm reading. They probably think I like Jeff Foxworthy too. Damn you Steve Lyons and your silly old picture of your mullet!
urlLink     urlLink     I don't know why I have such a penchant for parent/child shots. I love children, but there's just something utterly charming about these shots. Moments of that particular relationship captured on film (or digital doodaddery in this case). Just something about it.
urlLink      urlLink     E and I realized that last night's Giants vs. Cubs game was the ninth game we've seen together since last summer. I've definitely seen more games in the last few years than normal. I like that. He's now such baseball addict, he says that he wants to go see at least one Giants game a month. I love how addicted he is. He's busy reading Tim McCarver's  urlLink Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans  after he's read my Leonard Koppett's  urlLink Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball .  So the Giants won, so he was happy. Although Nomar had a kickass night. He went three for four, hit two doubles and a single. I was happy for him, especially as he was one of the few Cubbies steadily hitting against Schmidt (who had ten strikeouts). But it was wistful too. Seeing him play short, wearing the blue and grey uniform. Sigh.  And I taught Eufrey how to keep score. Although I had to rack my brain on some plays. I haven't really kept score since high school, so when Pedro Feliz made a stupid baserunning error and got tagged out between second and third and Bonds scooted over to second in the hullabaloo...I had no clue how to score that. Oops.  But yes, baseball is a huge part of our life at the moment. Lots of games (in person, on tv, even on the radio when our lack of cable curses us). Seeing as both the Sox and the Giants seem stuck on fighting for the Wild Card for the playoffs, we're both frustrated with their sub-par play and still struggling for hope that we have a shot in the playoffs.  It was nice hearing all those Cubbies fans last night cheering so loudly for Nomar, though.
urlLink      urlLink     I don't have much to say. But I'm walking someone through the process of learning how to use blogger, therefore I may as well go whole hog and post the picture I uploaded.  It's from the main library in San Francisco. Is that o
