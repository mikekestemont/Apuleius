 I dont know what to do or I should be  There's only one thing in my mind  That's you and me  Im a little bit of crazy  Im a little bit of a fool  Im a little bit of lonely  Im a little bit of all  Oh I need a cure  Just a little bit of you  And I will fall  Im always on the run to see you  Would you allow me to?  It wasnt my intention to hurt you  this feeling is true
last night when i was going to work i was already inside the jeepney when i found out that i forgot my wallet good thing i wasn't that far from the gate of the village yet,when i found out about my wallet i immediately took off the jeepney and headed way back home.i went straight to my bf's house which incidentally just 3 houses away from mine.when i called and i was standing i front of their house,when he went out i saw him dressed in basketball uniform,and his friend,he was a abit shocked,he didn't expect it.he asked me why i was there that i supposed to be on my way to office,i told him,i forgot my wallet.first we were together before i went to work and he didn't tell me anything about their basketball pratice.i didn't show any sign of resentment coz i didn't to go to office with heavy heart or feeling,so i went to work and i got home,i went straight to their house to eat breakfast, he's feeling me,if was mad,he told me"i know you're mad",i didn't show him any hard feeling in front of his brother,it's because i tried to be civil and still showed some respect,and when i went to my pad ( i'm renting a room 3 houses away from his house...sounds confusing to some,,i know)that's when i talked to him,i dunno if i got point to get mad for not asking permission from for his basketball practice and i know some of you wouldn't understand me,an dyou may even think,i have no right feel that way,just because of not asking permission.but anyways,bottomline,we're okay now...do i have all the right to feel that...
her's my first article,honestly i dunno what to write,and i'm kinda excited,thanks to my friend who told me about blog,actually,i've been planning to have a journal,i even bought something to write on,but i would just start for a day or two and i'd stop,sometimes i forgot,good thing i've found this site wherein i can log a journal everytime since everyday at work i'm able to use my pc and use the net. Maybe,i will start with a little introduction about myself... i'm 27y/o going 28(i have mixed feelings for that).i'm a shy type person, love to listen to people,love to converse.my friend's say i'm funny, maybe because i love to laugh too,i love people who have a great sense of humor. love about myself?....ALL hate about myself?....paranoid I love...my family,tet,my friends,green stuffs,nature,music,books, sydney sheldon's work,beatles,watch movie,listen to music,mostly i love to be alone....most of all....I LOVE LIFE... ;
