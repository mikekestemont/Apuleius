It is an absolutely beautiful day in c-bus today.  I am highly qualified to report this information as I sit facing a very large window to the outside world.  I am not in the least bothered by this, especially since if you've read my entries thus far, you know I'm  mostly  busy...  In any event, I get to watch the wonders of the world pass on by all day long.  In the midst of watching these "wonders" on a sunny day, I tend to question, "why aren't these people at work?"  Why do I have to suffer inside all day when these people are free to move about the world on the outside, especially on the warm, sunny, summer days?  Obviously I'm not too worried about my freedom over the winter months...as I'm usually warm and snuggly inside.  I find I am not the only person in my circle of friends that disagree with passing the days of the summer months inside an office building.  I find it especially amusing when I hear the dread stories of very little air conditioning on the hot summer days.  It is bad enough 1.)being holed up in an office atmosphere but 2.) to be extremely and uncomfortably hot in an office atmosphere...  Leaves me one thought..."give me liberty or give me death."  Ha Ha   Someone is soo dramatic!   : )  Oh well, anyway, I am staring out the window and I wish I was outside.  I guess that we all can't afford to be free to wander about the world during the summer days.  That is why I think my only option (besides death of course) is to become a teacher.  Is there any other profession that gives you 3 months paid vacation during the summer?  If so let me know!  I'm all over that!
I think as we get older a lot of self discovery just  occurs .  Maybe we have too much time to think?  Nevertheless, it's no use trying to pretend i'm something I'm not.  I've burdened myself enough thinking about this that I have to let it out.   Essentially, if something doesn't go my way, I don't like it.  Not only don't i like it but i get pretty aggravated because of it.  i haven't thought deeply enough to sort out if i should consider this a character "flaw" but i sure don't agree with this aspect of my personality.   i don't know what it is but i am a total brat when things don't go my way.  I'm not talking about life long goals or anything either...i mean those important things i'm sure to discover the outcome at a later date...  I am talking about the little things.  Need an example?  An incident from this weekend.  Oh i'm so embarrassed but i've got to get this off my chest.  This weekend, I went running with someone (i feel it's best not to implicate this person) and they decide to map out (quite spur of the moment) a course that has never been run before.  i think, great, the more a
