 i got an e-mail from my step-son today. he just moved to anaheim to go to a computer animation school and is trying to find a job. he said when he goes to a business for an application they say they have none and he can see a big stack of them on the counter...he says they hire mostly hispanics and asians and have no use for sk8er guys like him. i was cracking up. poor kid, the real world ain't all it's cracked up to be. all i can think is thank god he is going to college.
the very first thing I must go off about is catty bitches. holy shit women suck. they are the most competitive, back stabbing, vicious creatures in the world. i know that i'm one of them, but i prefer the company of a straight forward, no bullshit male any day. i don't know how men put up with us.  is it fair to say that there are different degrees of catty bitches? it's my philosophy that the more "girlie" the girl, the more catty she is. this has been my observation anyway. this may be because i am not a girlie girl and neither are most of my friends. and no, we are not lesbians and yes, we are all fairly attractive, but we are the type of chick who guys don't mind hanging with because we're "cool" (their admission, not ours).  i'm thinking about catty bitches a lot these days because i quit my job a few weeks ago and have been moping about not finding another job. i worked for an organization for girls (i won't name any names for fear of having the queens of catty unleashed on me with a lawsuit or something), but you will probably figure it out. the organization wasn't the problem, it was the fucking bitches who work and volunteer for the organization--and when i say fucking  bitches, i mean cunts. now, i don't use that term lightly, it is reserved for the scum sucking bottom feeders in the sea of womankind.  i worked at this office for almost four years as the communications director and loved my job. it was perfect for me. i could demonstrate my creative genius on almost a daily basis. but, in the background of my employment nirvana was this constant undercurrent of cat fight. no joke, there was never a day when someone wasn't struggling to overthrow someone else. oh, did i mention that all of the employees were women?  anyway, i can't sum this up in one posting, it would be the longest post in history. instead, i will throw it in here and there as it enters my brain. bad medicine is much better taken in small doses. for now, death to all catty bitches!!
I'm still working on making my blog look cool. I was trying to add a pic to my profile by going through the whole "hello" thing, and it just ended up being a post. Oh well, that's me anyway.
