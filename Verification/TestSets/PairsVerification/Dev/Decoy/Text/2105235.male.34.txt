a blog also, I told her about this site and she started one a few days ago. She has kept a journal for a long time but she has just moved to online journals this last year or so.  I never kept a journal. You will read stuff about my childhood here and my current life. I feel I need to write down something to clear my head and make peace with some of the things that have happened in my life.
It has been a while since my last post. I have been busy with playing games with the family and trying to design my own games. I have found a passion of mine, "Design." I love to design things, build things.  My wife has helped me keep focus on one thing at a time. I tend to try so many things at once, but this time I'm staying on one thing and that is game design. I have a lot of ideas I write down in another blog, but only a few have been good enough for me to give them a second thought.  I use to design things with as childhood friend of mine named Joe. We grew up together from the 4th grade. We both always help one another with ideas we had for new toys and games we could play. I think people thought we were crazy, because some of the things we did. We were kids without a care in the world.  We use to rip brand new toys apart to find out how they worked and how me could modify them to be better in our eyes. We always changed the rules of any games we played.  I wish we could still do this type of thing together with my renewed passion for game design. But we cannot. Joe was killed on his motorcycle when we were 24 years old. I really miss him a lot and have every day of my life since that day in October 22 of 1994.  So I still design things and enjoy it. I think Joe would like some of the things I have come up with.
Well, I sent the prototype of my new card game called "ESP" to Atlas Games. Everyone I played it with liked it and gave great input. I hope Atlas Games likes it too. My friend Chris is going to do the art work for the game. He does some really wild dark art so I expect the art he will do for the game will have the same theme as the rest of his work.  I can't wait to hear from Atlas Games. If they do not like it, I will receive input on the game and this is always good. I'm also working on a new d20 accessory call "Unknown Heroes" that Atlas Games wants to review. I still need to compile all my notes and create a prototype.  I think I will be done this weekend with it, I hope and should be able to finish the prototype by next w
