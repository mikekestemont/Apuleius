concludes my muchly abridged week!
urlLink   A BLEACH BLONDE Penguin Lies Beneath!    I took the  urlLink Inner Penguin online quiz  and found out I am a Bleach Blonde Penguin on the inside. Now this is quite a do-gooder kind of penguin. ^^ Being one of these wondrous birds is quite the experience; I'm what can be known as 'the quiet one' or in some extreme cases 'the wussy one'. This is because I have a great affinity for helping people out. My broad repertoire of healing techniques are well-known. Those who stick by me are lucky, as I tend to help them when help is most needed.   I don't think much of myself, and never put my own well-being above my friends. I'm calm, pleasant, intelligent, and vastly fun to talk to. On the battlefield, however, my healing purposes are my only strength. When it comes down to actually fighting, I'm not exactly gifted. Hiding behind a strong friend is always the best option! XD    This is old, but way awesome. :D
As I said before, I went to my grandparents' 50th anniversary party. The  seeecret  one. They seemed to be pretty suprised. I took pictures, recorded stuff, and talked to relatives of whom  no clue  of their relation to me. And my uncle who was hosting the thing had his dog running around, slobering on everything. *twitch, twitch* If America was a dictatorship, and I were running it, I would have a huuuge dog genocide. It'd be like Hitler's, only mine would make sense. But anways, it was never too boring considering what it was. My mom did a great job planning it all.  These entries are getting so vague. ;)
Chi got reconnected, like, two days ago. That makes me happy. But right now, everyone's depressed. That makes me sad. Zefer's being all weird again. Supposedly, he's leaving us.  Then it got contageous, and Karma got depressed. He said he was leaving. And Chi got it too, and he left as well. Then I decided to hop on the bandwagon and threatened to leave as well. I never can tell when we're being serious, but hopfully they'll all be coming back. =/  Anyhow, not going to be around tomorrow. Anniversary thing. Hurrah.
It's been a busy few days. Especially with relatives over. First, on Saturday, my gandparents came. We went on a walk in some marsh. Which sounds stupid. And more or less  was . I still got some pretty pictures though. I'll post them here if I can get the digital forms.  Sunday, there was some anniversary of some aunt of an aunt that I don't really know. But I didn't have to go. Thank god. OLD PEOPLE  SMAAASH .  Then, Monday, my uncle who's in the navy came home. But my grandparents don't know, because it's a surprise! OMG, the secrecy. Anyways, he'll be staying here till Saturday when we throw my grandparents a  seeecreet anniversary party  of their own. That might actually be fun, because apparently, I get to take pictures and video tape stuff. I'm  so  doing commentary. :
