But, I don't have a clue how to write html, so my format is all screwed up.  But - VOTE IN THE POLL WOO HOO!

I am addicted to the Bachelor, Survivor, Real World, Road Rules, For Love or Money, etc. They are fun, harmless entertainment. No big deal.  But...Any show involving marriage makes me sick to my stomach. Marriage is important. It is sacred. It is not something to mess with. Mom-swapping, wife-swapping, attempts to break couples up...It really, really bothers me.  I hated Temptation Island. But, I figured that those couples must have some major problems to even sign up for that show. I must have been wrong - now we have so many shows marrying off people, pretending to marry off people, breaking up married couples, or trading spouses - it is terrible.  I am married. I love my husband. And I think that anyone who tries to break us up deserves to live a miserable, horrible life. It is wrong, just wrong. I would NEVER swap my George for some other stupid guy. I know that people cheat, people break up, marriages dissolve for all kinds of reasons. It happens. However, let's not encourage it unless it is absolutely needed. Let's not allow these networks to make money off of destroying marriages. People can do that all by themselves if they want to, but I don't think the American viewing public should support them.  BOYCOTT.
But I hope this happens.  OSCAR HEAT: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 may be disqualified from this year's Oscars because Cuba's government aired the doc on state-run television, in violation of Academy rules that says a feature film can't air on the tube within nine months of its release.  Here's why.  Not because it isn't a great movie. Not because it isn't "daring" and "provocative." But, because it was created solely for the purpose of defeating a president, and I don't think it would be very fun for a piece of propoganda to win a best picture oscar.  It's more fun when things like Braveheart or Shindler's List win - movies that make a point, even if political, but aren't so obvious.  Just my opinion.  And, frankly, I'm rooting for New York Minute - MK and A can REALLY tear it up.

It is supposed to be a legitimate scholarship program, providing a role model for young American women.  Cmon ABC - we all know that crazy talent is what makes a role model!  Although I always got bored during the talent competition and turned the channel, it is important to this show.  We all know that talent is the real reason that anyone becomes Miss America.  That, and nice T
