wah this seems all so serious a potential book..novel...DVD COLLECTION!  so lets share. i can share. I am a huge sharereererer.  Lets start from the beginning, wait i changed my mind, my writing professor mentioned something about starting in the middle of things to make things more interesting.  THE MIDDLE LAND OR THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE AS MOST AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE. wait a second that title is too loong. But its nice to.  i will leave it there. Here we go..I will start again. From somewhere in between Andre 3000 and MR BIG.  BLEEDING THUMBS Moving to california was hard. I have to say, my final days with my mates were spent crying , getting drunk, peeing on the streets of brooklyn  between 2 cars and falling asleep on the fire escape  outside my window will be so engraved on my heart so  much so that even my tattoos will fade faster.  So the morning of my departure from my adobe in Brooklyn can be rivaled to any episode of ER this season. I had my own little punjabi doctor at hand an interesting Noah Wyle in my head and blood , lots of blood. I was trying to fix my glasses in the morning with a nice little fat knife. what follows is alot of blood that is only exxagerated by spit and white washed sinks. Yes you see, its instinctual to stick your bleeding thumb  into your mouth to suck on it when you cut it. but what follows is a mouth full of blood and  a white sink that glows with its presence and contrasts. needless to say, i fainted haha. yes i can laugh now yes i could laugh 3 hours later on the plane being slighty detoured cause of the tornado's in the middle kingdom. My roommate of course saved me picked me up caught me wrapped my thumb tried to induce some 'fucking just stay and miss the flight la' therapy to make it all seem like a distant dream but no i had to be strong it has to happen. So together we trotted to JFK with a mission. To set me and  my bleeding thumb off to the west coast. i did look like i was trying to hitch a ride hahaha  LA LA LAND: yes yes finally here not completely settled down the hardest was letting go my old nyc mobile number. but the beach, material comforts, family and the sun is helping.   BROOKLYN INDUSTRIES: there is this store it sells really cool clothes me and mariana are  mates she works there My constant contact with a stranger  it was nice just having her call and be like so whats the deal ? you moved to california? yes yes my dear mariana, i m oved to cali caliente YOU must miss brooklyn huh she would sing over the phone  between our little pink sweatshirt discussions ( you see i ordered one , but it didn't get there in time) talking to a stranger that suddenly became a friend  h
