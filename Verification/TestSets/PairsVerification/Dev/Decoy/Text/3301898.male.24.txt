urlLink The Poet of Dirty Words - History takes a second look at Philip Larkin. By Stephen?Burt   One of Britain's best-known modern poems cannot be quoted on American network television. The offending word arrives in the very first line:    They fuck you up, your mum and dad,      They may not mean to but they do They fill you with the faults they had      And add some extra just for you.  But they were fucked up in their turn      By fools in old style hats and coats Who half the time were soppy-stern      And half at one another's throats.  Man hands on misery to man.      It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can      And don't have any kids yourself.  The poem is "This Be the Verse," and its author, Philip Larkin (1922-85), is back in the news, thanks to a radical revision of his Collected Poems. By the time of his death, Larkin, a grumpy, publicity-shy librarian, had become an unlikely celebrity, a rabbity symbol for his readers' accumulated regrets, calling his own childhood "a forgotten boredom." For the first edition of Larkin's Collected Poems (1988), the editor, Anthony Thwaite, printed all Larkin's verse in chronological order, with published and unpublished, finished and unfinished, verse side by side. Already controversial in Britain, Thwaite's new edition instead reprints the books as Larkin published them during his lifetime, followed by verse that appeared in magazines, and omitting everything left in manuscript at his death. The new volume ought to help new and old readers make sense of this cantankerous, sometimes contradictory poet. It also shuts out some of his best poems.  A product of middle England's middle class, Larkin graduated from Oxford in 1943 hoping to make it as a novelist. Instead he fell into librarianship, moving from a small town's stacks to academic library work at Leicester, Belfast, and then to unglamorous Hull, where he stayed. He did publish two literary novels, Jill (1946), the tale of a shy undergraduate's self-defeating fantasies, and A Girl in Winter (1947), a bleaker book about postadolescent resignation. Success, when it came, came slowly, and only for his verse. The Less Deceived (1955) placed Larkin at the head of the class of modest, grim young English poets known as the Movement. (The Anglo-American poet Thom Gunn, who died this April, was once grouped with the Movement too.) With poems about slow trains, old boarding schools, and village World War I commemorations, The Whitsun Weddings (1964) made Larkin a poet of undoubted influence; High Windows (1974), which included "This Be the Verse," made him famous. (He later turned down the job of poet laureate.)  The same book made him the poet of dirty words. "Sad Steps" begins with the poet "Groping back to bed after a piss." The title poem opens: "Whenever I see a couple of kids/ And guess he's fucking her and she's/ Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm â€¦" The Dutch painting in "The Card Players" depicts "Jan van Hogspeuw," "Dirk Dogstoerd" and "Old Prijck."
