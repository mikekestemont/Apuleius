many new and (sometimes) interesting situations that I will find myself in over the coming year.  I want to start off by making two disclaimers:   First, I have never attempted to keep a weblog before so please bear with me in the coming weeks as I try to hone my abilities to both update the blog regularly, as well as to clean up what is sure to be sloppy writing in my first several elongated posts.  Additionally, once school starts in earnest my posts will likely shrink in size and frequency, but I am committed to following through with this project through at least the next year.  Secondly, I have decided that in order for me to honestly and truthfully convey my feelings about the situations that I will find myself in and the persons who I will be working with and for over the coming months, I feel that I, and the other subjects of my posts, must remain anonymous.  Accordingly, I will use initials to identify the people in my life and I will occasionally change or mask certain details if I feel that they will reveal my identity, or of equal importance, the identities of others.

I know what actions I want to take in the moment, but I also consider how those actions will affect my long term desires in the future, and at this point in my life my long term goals are paramount.    Most law students are good followers, which is not a bad thing because that is a necessary quality for one to have in order to be successful in law school.  Law students are given fact patterns, and must analyize them within the context of a certain set of rules.  Students are not allowed to think outside of the rules, and excess creativity is not appreciated by professors.  While most of my colleagues seem to like to believe that they fall within the class of "Type-A" personalities, it is my contention that they do not.  The law forces students to conform to one way of thinking, which is something that I have struggled with, and thats where I will pick up with my next post.  Over the coming weeks I will focus mostly on my experiences from last year, intermidently discussing my current travails as a summer law clerk for a government prosecutor.  Consider this to be a primer for the real subject of this weblog, my second year of law s
