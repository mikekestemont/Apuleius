but I had a nice buzz.  I had talked to him earlier in the night.  But then there he was--sitting on the steps near the ladies room!  *sigh*  He's so dreamy!  LOL!  So I decided to test him.  I wanted to see if he would acknowledge me if I pretended that I didn't know he was there.  So, I get in the bathroom line.  (Ladies' room lines will be a topic for another night!)  And I'm right in front of him...making like I didn't see him.  A couple seconds go by, which felt like hours, and he finally goes, "Lisa ****!"  He always calls me by my first AND last name, or just my last name, or my initials.  And he used to make up all these horrible nick-names for me, which HE thinks are absolutely hysterical!  (I just think they're cute b/c HE made them up!) Oh, good Lord, that's just sad!  But yes.  So, I'm like, "OH HI!"  (My acting skills came in handy for pretending like I was surprised to see him sitting there!  Heheh).   So, we're talking about work and stuff--ya know, the lame small talk.  And mind you, I HATE trying to talk to someone in a club.  It's always like, "Hi, how are you?"  "WHAT DID YOU SAY?"  "I SAID HOW ARE YOU?"  You know the drill.  Anyway, at one point, we had the eye contact!  I love the eye contact!  Then, he makes it a point to pick some lint or something off my skirt.  (And I swear I caught him look me up and down a couple times!)  So, there I am, in mid-sentence when he says, "Oh, I want you to meet my girlfriend!"   My heart just stopped.  I suddenly felt like I was back in 9th grade, horrified to find out that the oh-so-cute Student Council President was dating a pretty little cheerleader.  To make matters worse, this girl was beautiful!  And I'm not a bitch, so of course I shook her hand (and I mean I really shook it--I'll discuss girls with "fish hands" another day!)  And she even had a normal name that I can't make fun of!   That made it EVEN worse!  His last girlfriend was named after freakin' weather!  And she wasn't drop dead gorgeous, either.  I've never felt too threatened by any of his girlfriends before.  It's like I always knew they wouldn't last and I'd still have my chance.  But I'm worried about this one!  Granted I talked to her for 3 seconds, but I'm just paranoid.  They're gonna get married and I'll lose him forever.    Oh yeah, so then he says, "So, what were you saying?"  Well, I had totally lost my whole train of thought!  I just kinda stammered, "I don't remember," and walked away.  Suddenly, I felt like I was all alone.  The walls were caving in on me, the whole club seemed like it was pointing and laughing at me, my friends were nowhere to be found, and my whole world came crashing down!   I was all alone in the c
