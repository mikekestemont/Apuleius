I had an opportunity to reflect on the direction of my life and my choice of careers.  For the past 4 years I had decided to go into Computer Graphic Design and so had been taking the courses necessary for that industry.  So as I was contemplating I realized that I had one key issue with the majority of the jobs that I had accepted to do.  The ones that required me to be onsite and under the direction of some sort of management were not enjoyable.  Now I don't mean that the projects were not fun but that I did not enjoy the direction management was trying to form me.  Well to make a long boring story short I have decided to change my career path.  I am finishing my last two classes to get an A.A.  in Computer Graphic Design and then I am off to ITT Technical School to become and receive a B.A. in Computer Systems Networking Administration.  Not only do I feel that this is a much better field of work for me but it will also provide and support the kind of life style that I desire to have.  Well I hope that wasn't to boring or confusing for you if it was drop me an email and I'll explain it better for you.
Yes, I am a complete slacker.  I apologize to all of you who have found my blog and have been reading it.  Fortunately, some of my experiences can be found at  urlLink MercuryFrog.com .  But as of late I have been extremely busy with many projects.  I have been repairing my friend Merc's bike.  I have been trying to find stone tiling that is stone shaped to put in our kitchen. I have also been making connections with a guy at SEMA  and at PriMedia.  Both working on publications for magazines.  I am really hopeful that PriMedia works out.  Especially since where I am at now is moving their graphics to Taiwan because that's where they do their printing.  Which kind of sucks because I just started to get into the groove here.
Every day when I come home from work.  I see my baby girl and she smiles right at me.  She brings such a warm joyful feeling to my heart.  I get so excited when I see her, and as I look into her face I see how much she really resembles her mommy.  Then I am immediately reminded of my love and adoration for my wife and how I truly do love her and why I married her. Life brings so many challenges, hardships and frustrations but it also brings the most joys,  exhilarations and fun.  My two most precious and most valuable things in life are my Baby Girls, Heather and E.V. I love them deeply
A few things are frustrating me at this point in my life.  Some important and some not so important. First the "Not So" I now have two web sites one for my business and one for my family and I (Heather, my wife a
