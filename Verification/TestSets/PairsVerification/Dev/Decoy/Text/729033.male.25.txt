Forever and I have been active lil'bunnies, and it's been amazing. The thing he does with his... and then with the... followed by... ummm, okay. Just kidding! Actually, it has been good and amazing. I mean, when the moment comes and we are holding eachother, there is nothing in the world that I can compare it to. It's bliss and it's me and him, together, sharing the moment. Sex is great! However, don't go out and do it just because I think it is amazing. Oh no! No, no, no, no! Make sure you're ready. It's a lot more amazing when there is love between you and your partner. Trust me. It's more than sex. It's love.

urlLink    Saved! Oh my god! This movie was so funny! Go see it right now! Jenna Malone and Mandy Moore are hilarious! To quote a bumper sticker in the movie; "Jesus loves you... the rest of the world thinks you're an asshole" -- Love it!
It's been 6 months since I move to Vegas to be with Mr. Forever. And I got to say that in our time together it's been near perfect. It really has. I really enjoy his company and cherish the times we spend together. I know, I know. I'm sounding like a love-struck-fool again. But I am, so YOU must deal with it. Plus, it's my diary and I will talk about ME ME ME if I choose to! Anyway, I know its been a while since I've post anything, and I've really been meaning too, but I've been somewhat busy. That, and I've had a bad case of writer's block. But I'm writing something now, so thats good. I'm watching 'Mommie Dearest' and simlutaneously writing this. Why do I love this movie? Anyway, 6 months in Vegas and I'm not a junkie/trampy/prostitute hoe! Yay me! Here's to 6 more months!  (update: Someone asked me how the sex was, and if it had decreased since I started living with Mr. Forever. Well, let me start off by saying NO. No, it has not decreased. We do whoopie way to much, really. (Whoa, did I say 'whoopie'? I'm 25 damn years old! I meant, sex! SEX! It's called SEX now!) It's kind of scary. I mean, I don't want to sound (or make us sound) like [a] sex-crazed freak(s), but sex is good everytime, especially twice a day.)
I made some updates on my website, finally! I know, I know. Anyway, I added a SHOUTBOX to the start page, which is cool and easy to use. I hope it looks good. I might end up taking it off if it sucks! I'm also doing a music review entry, but I don't know when I'll get done with that. I might just drop the music page altogether and post the reviews here. I've been listening to a lot of music lately, and it ranges from old-school Sinatra, to heavy metal Strata! Anyway, e
