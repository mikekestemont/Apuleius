though..must sleepp.....ack.
I can't believe I'm the only girl in TFS that plays Ragnarok Online and Gunbound.  I need someone to play with!  Waaaah!  I'm also one of the few(and proud)geeky anime fans at school(though Daniel would never call himself as geeky and obsessive as me in anime).  In short, ANYONE please play with me!  My account on Ragnarok Online is called Lady Capulet (The name of ultimate geekiness i know).  My account on Gunbound is called Erline.  Help!
Have I been abandoned on this blog now?  Am I the only survivor?  Come on, guys.  Adam, Dana, Daniel, Chris, David, Olivia, Simone, Jenny, Marc-Adam, Michelle!  This blog has a total of 11 members (including me in that count) and no one is posting?  We've pulled through grade 7 together on this blog.  Let's finish up grade 8 in a grand flourish to show our dedication to this blog.  I can't believe some people just joined and never posted up a single thing.  >:( I'm afraid I can't let anyone be able to be proud of being on this blog if they never post.  You can't just join for the sake of bragging that you're on this site.  You have to help somehow to help it grow and blossom.  >_ :D
Daniel joined the blog but it seems like he has nothing to say...*sigh*  we are the only survivors, Dana!  Wahahahah!  We have triumphed!  Well...not really..-_-
Nicole dude.  You are an utter complete genius.  All hail Nikki.All hail Nikki..ah..no. jks..I was recently lookin over the letters that people gave me for march break last year in grade 7 and they are sooooo funny.joy joy.
Its been a while since i said anything on this blog. Blogger has changed alot since i was last on it
Why is he such a donkey fart? Today was Tennis finales.  I played for games and won 2 of them...the others were a complete bummer..I dont know if TFS came in 3rd or 4th...either one of hem..i dont really know which one cuz i left while a doubles team was still playing..We werent 1st which is  double bummer but at least we're still getting pizza..MUHAHAH to you all
David is a stupid donkey fart.  He's also a fruitcake. I rest my case.
Bahahahah!  I made a sort of anime character blog.  Olivia has joined too.  I hope Christina can as well.  I'm playing Haruno Sakura from Naruto, Olivia is Miyazawa Yukino from Kare Kano and...and...well, i'm not even sure if Christina will join.  Woohoo!  This is ultimate animefan geekiness!  lol the address is: riceballtrio.blogspot.com
Just two more exams....french and science...brignoli is my death subject....chocolate chips are yummy.  yes..i know..i  AM  slightly going crazy.
I have just seen the Triplets of Belleville.  It is the cheeseeness of cheese.  It is pure, utter, CRAP.  There is no friggen dialogue in that thing that these people call "movies".  Say it with me now "M-O-V-I-E-S" I am ever so pissed.
Dana is now feeling :  urlLink
lol!  I hate those now...so pointless..anyways, i gave up on blogger (too hard to format for me).  My journal is now on livejournal.  Here's the link:  h
