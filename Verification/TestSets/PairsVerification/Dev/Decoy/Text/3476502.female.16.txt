Music: Before I'm Dead - Kidneythieves Mood: Happy ***********************  Today, I fixed my curtains so it'll be dark in my room...! It's really helped my room stay cold...! I'm watching Queen of the Damned right now... it's a great movie! I have the Soundtrack playing in the background...! It's at the Concert scene... I like the one before it, it's very emotional!  It's going to rain all night... which I'm glad... I love the rain, it helps me sleep...!  Ugg, my mom found cigarette butts outside on the porch, and she thought it was me for a while, but I didn't want to tell her it was Evans!! Because she would tell his mom and there would be problems! I told her to let me handle it... because she finally forced it out of me... I told her that it would be simpler if I took care of it, so that was I can make up lies and scare him... like it'll shrink his penis!  Hahahaha, I'm funny!  ::hears wind blowing and rain hitting the window:: OOO! IT'S BEGINNING! I HAVE TO GO TO A RAIN SPELL! I'm going to try to make it last a while! w00t!   Love all!!
Music:  World So Cold - Mudvayne  Mood:  bored outta my mind!  ********************************   I am currently watch 'Fifth Element', it's a very good movie! I like the part when the blue Diva sings... it's really pretty!  I feel bad... I killed a spider and a younger one was sitting right there... I wonder if it was it's parent or something...
