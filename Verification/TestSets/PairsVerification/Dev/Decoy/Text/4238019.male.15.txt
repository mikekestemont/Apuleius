Realising that it is just 12 days to my 15th birthday, I am glad to know it. =) Time flies so fast everyday that you have to catch up with time. In school today, for PE lesson, we did the ACES Day workout at the hockey pitch as the hall was used up by the Seconday 4NA for their Prelims. The actions of the workout were so lame man... I remembered the last dance I did last time was "Let's get loud" by J.Lo . Yeah~ it was cool and funky. The exercise included "Where is the love" by Black Eye Peas. Ms Yeow did not come to school today again, so our class went outside the staff room to assemble. Quite a "bored" first half of the day. After recess, it was History. I felt relieved when there was no test. We did sourced based questions. During E Maths lesson, we have A Maths test. After the test, we had "conflicts" for the last question. We kept argueing for the last question to see who is right... hahahax.. get back the paper then see who correct la! Lol. Today got no homework.. so slack man. Ok, I'll stop here today...  Nothing much happening today. I'm off to watch EPL Highlights on ESPN.  Cyaz.. Good Bye!~
Happie birthday to you, diary! You're 1 week old now. =P. Got my hair cut yesterday, betta looking now eh? hahahax. Manchester United 2-1 Norwich City! Yeah! Manchester United won!! Bellion's beautiful strike and Smith's superb volley made me proud of the 8th time English Premiership Champion team! I watched the match, and i enjoyed it. =P. This morning, I woke up and realised grandma was illed. Grandma, may God heal you with his love and faith for you and have speedy recovery too. I went to church this morning(as usual every Sunday =) ) and went to L2 Audiotrium as there was no Youth service. The worship was good and the Word by Pastor Rajkumar Ramchandran was great! I payed full attention to him, as the words he speaked made me so engrossed and focused during Word.Learnt quite a few things from church today too.   After service, I stayed back to play soccer wif my friends. My soccer skills improved and my accuracy was on target this afternoon. I was glad, of cos. After that, I went bowling wif Ben Thia and Dexter. First game, I won them. Yeah~ But second game, I managed second position :\. My top score today was only 114, where my highest score for bowling is 174. Off form today. After bowling, its arcade! My virtual striker skills improved and won Ben and Dex 6 times in a row, althought I lost to them quite a few rounds when starting.... =X. Went home after that. Finished doing Physics and Pure Geography homework. Slacking a while so that later can study of tommorrow's History test and A Maths Test. I'll stop here for now. Thank you guys and Good Nite.
