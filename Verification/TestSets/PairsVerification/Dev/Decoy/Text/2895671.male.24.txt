most likely that this new window is covering up some of the window that's containing your document.  Click on the little icon of a thumb tack on the bottom frame of the Beamer window. That should allow you to see your document as well as the Beamer information.   Your Beamer window should like something like this. In the left hand window, expand the directory tree (click on the + signs) to display your table containing the data to be mail-merged, as I have done here.  It's now time to replace the asterisk in your letter with the data from your data source.  Click on the first column heading in the spreadsheet you created. In my example, this would be the block labeled Hero's Name. Holding down your left-mouse button, drag the block down into your letter and release it next to the appropriate asterisk. Repeat this step for each heading in your data table, everywhere you require this data to appear in your letter. Like this...   Once you've gotten all of the data field properly represented in your letter, click on the little icon in your Beamer window that looks like a stack of envelopes (it's the second-last icon on the right). This will bring up the Form Letter window. If you wish to have each of the letters (for each entry in the spreadsheet) printed, leave the output set to Printer and click on OK.  If you'd rather have the letters created then saved to your hard drive for printing later, click on the bullet labeled File then click on OK.  That's it! Now, each letter will have the unique information that you've specified for each individual, and you've just saved yourself allot of extra work.    :)
Writer handles a few tasks differently, though, like the examples listed below. Here's how to deal with them:          Word count:  Go to File and click on Properties and Statistics, you'll see the word count.           Highlighting:   Change a highlighting color or un-highlight something by right clicking on the Highlight icon. Hold the pressure down for a moment, and a selection of colors appears.           Fonts:   OpenOffice gives you a decent selection, without getting extravagant like MS Office. OpenOffice offers the key ones such as Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Courier New, Garamond and Tahoma.           Finding features:   OpenOffice lists most features in the same place as MS Office, but not all. For example: You'll find templates in the File menu, tables in the Insert menu and collaboration features in the Edit menu.           Numbering/font corruption:   Anyone who's ever used Word is familiar with hassles with numbering and fonts. For instance, you cut and paste text into a document and then as you edit the document, the fonts change, the text goes bold and so on. OpenOffice reduces this confusion significantly, and also cuts down on trouble related to automatic numbering sequences.              Paste:   One problem with Writer is that when you paste text from the Web into a document, it automatically puts it in a separate box. There's probably a workaround for it, but I haven't found it y
