summer but oh well lol. I say that way to much. So I dont know what else to say, 'cept laters!!! ~ashley~
The color red is very interesting. I was reading somewhere that men have a harder time distinguishing various colors of red, but women can distinguish all kinds of red. This is because women have a certain gene on each of thier chromesomes and men only have one. This is why men are more likely to be color blind. Even in the days when we were hunters and gatherers women needed to detect the diferences between poisiones berries and edable berries, two different reds. And it is a good thing men did not have to do that or we might not even exist lol. Thought this was interesting and I thought I would share it with who ever reads this. ttyl ~ashley~
I was reading through some other peoples stuff and I thought about the game chubby bunnies. Do you remember when you were a kid at camp (if you went lol) you would play chubby bunnies? Well if you have never played the game, you shove marshmallows or something soft and squishy in you mouth, and then try to say chubby bunnies. Who ever can shove the most marshmallows into you mouth and still say chubby bunnies, wins. It is a very funny game to play with your friends when you are at camp lol. Just thought I would share this though with the people who might read this.  ~ashley~
I was reading some stuff on human memory. We have 2 types of long tirm memory;episodic and semantic. Episodic memory is our memeory of events that take place in our lifes. These memories help us bring back any moments in our lifes. Semantic memory is our memory that tells us what we have learned and what we retain. It helps us learn from our past experiences so we can learn new concepts. This interests me very much. I dont really know where I am going with this but I dont want to remember any of what has happened with all my so called friends in like the past summer. Very bad memories. Well that is enough of the memory stuff for now. later. ~ashley~
is pointless. You do the same thing from day to day, week to week, just to get money but i guess that is a good enough reason to do it. I could never be a lawer. Their jobs are sooo boring and bland I could never do it. Well I am off to lunch then back to the same old same old. Blah. ~ashley
is wierd sometimes. You never really know what is going to happen next, unless you are truly God. This can be a good thing sometimes but other times it can be horrible. You can ruin you life with one sentence, word, even one look. LIfe is random. Life isnt long, so take it slow,and not too seriously, you'll never get out alive. I like that saying. LOL. Well i guess that is enough from me.  ~
