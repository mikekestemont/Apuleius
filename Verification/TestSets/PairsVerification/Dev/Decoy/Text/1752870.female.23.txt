We hope you like the web site. I'm sure you have a lot to say to the world. Here's your chance. This is your very own Blog (web log). You can tell the world, or just your friends, whatever you want. Maybe some day soon it will be a place for you to tell your fans what it's like on the set of the movie your starring in. Maybe you just want to talk about cats or how cute your niece is. It's up to you to use this how ever you see fit. Just remember we're watching.
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. I enjoyed the city of brotherly love with all the love I could muster. I miss the people, don't miss the city. Miss my friends, don't miss the city. Miss cute guys, don't miss the city. What's a girl to do? I know, I'll become rich and famous and transplant EVERYONE out here.  I knocked out a good portion of my script, and found the travel to be productive. I sat across from a man who gave the ebola virus to the whole plane with his coughing fits, but ebola kills slow, so I'll be here a bit longer. It was hot, it was humid, it was...moist. I trashed my hotel room like a rock-star, then cleaned it all up like the OCD virgo that I am.

Does Meghan twitch and babble and shift in her chair when she's nervous? Yes, I believe she does. Venison? Veal? Turtles? Who shoots a turtle?! Kraig does.  But here I am, safe and sound, visiting my homeless cat. Mommy loves her Bear, but Bear is having separation issues.  And now, for something completely different...

Howdy, all! It must scare you to know that I now have a medium to release my tedious knowledge into the world. But you can do nothing to stop me, so just sit-back, relax, enjoy the ride.  I am very grateful to my squidgy brother and sister (shmoop 1 and shmoop 2)for doing this for me. You have earned a prominant spot in the Oscar speech! Congrats. Lily doesn't need a spot, 'cause she's coming on stage with me to be the official "statue-holder". I know that such a position does not exist currently, but it shall as soon as I start the trend.  I just wanted everyone to know how much I appreciate your love and support in my race for the spotlight. I know that no matter what, you'll be there for me; but let's be real...you'd rather be "there for me" in the matching Ferrari's I intend to purchase for the family. Well, hold your horses, I'm getting there. Brad Pitt was on soap's before h
