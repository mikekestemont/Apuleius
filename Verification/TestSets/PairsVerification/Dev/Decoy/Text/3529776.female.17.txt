It's weird to have "Leaf" as the title of this entry.  I felt like all my life I've been a leaf, the greenish thing that is around the flowers.  Flowers are beautiful.  They are the ones that people like to look at.  They are always on the spot light.  They are always special in different ways.  Leaves are not noticable.  They are either green or brown.  They can be in different shade of green and brown, but that does not make a difference to a lot of people.  People always say that if there is no leaf, the flowers would not be as beautiful as they are.  That's because leaves are so plain, plain things would make pretty things even better and noticable.  I believe I'm a leaf.  I'm always around people, the ones that shines.  People like me are necessary to make others better.  All my life I tried to work my way up to become a flower, but now I'm tired.  Tired of changing myself, I know that no matter how hard I try, I can never become someone else or even change my appearance.

No matter how hard I tried, no one seem to notice me because I'm like many others.  I blend in, that's why I'm not outstanding.  Because I'm a leaf, I appreicates the friends that I have around me.  They are wonderful and unique.  However, being around them makes me realize more about how plain I am as a person.  I'm never a very significant person to anyone in their life.  This is the story of my life as a leaf.
Crying often starts with sad feelings.  My heart starts to feel the pain.  Starts to have difficulty breathing.  My nose starts to feel werid and I know it starts to turn red.  Tears comming up in my eyes.  As more tears gathers, it flows out my eyes and goes down my cheeks.  Then some drops down on my clothes or on the floor.  Trying so hard to breath and stop myself but the tears are still comming.  It's hard to stop yourself from crying.
I haven't really explain what Final Fantasy means to me.  As most people know Final Fantasy is a very popular video game.  I love the characters in Final Fantasy XII.  It also has a second meaning to me.  My final fantasy, the fantasy that I know that would never come true.  After all it is just a fantasy.  I don't know if everyone in this world has his or her own fantasy.  My fantasy is to live in a peaceful place where there is no discrimination, jealousy, hate, dipute, and broken heart.  This is p
