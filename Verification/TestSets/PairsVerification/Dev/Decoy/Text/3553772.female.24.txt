boys and girls don’t have t.v.’s in their homes.  To him, bread was nonnegotiable.  Its sponge-like capacity ensured his wife’s delicious sauces never went to waste and its firm crust carried the cheese to his mouth with a satisfying crunch.  It was, versatile and reliable.  The base of every meal.    Talking to my friend Kathleen the next week, I realized how out of control the whole Atkins thing was getting.  She told me they were now making Atkins DAIRY PRODUCTS.  “I’m sorry,” she said “but since when is MILK laden with carbs?”    Before I had time to react, she then remembered an even better example. “Okay,” she paused for effect, “COKE has made a low-carb version.”    I gasped.  With the professional-dieter-seriousness of a Valley Girl, I asked, “You mean the REGULAR stuff?”    Not missing a beat, Kathleen said “like, ever heard of DIET?!?”
There are so many unkind things people say.  It’s when their words touch your sad, insecure, mushy apple-bruise spots that it really hurts.    In this case, I think you could look like Angelina Jolie and still be stung by what happened to me today.

I laughed along maniacally.  “Good answer!  No it’s of course my sister.”  I patted Jennifer’s leg and imagined shoving eating utensils up his nostrils.

She nodded sympathetically, and just when I’m sure she’s about to launch into something about how crazy people are, she says, “yes, my sister is prettier than me too.”
Jennifer and I jogged in Les Jardins du Luxembourg today.  She said later she felt like she’d been getting some strange looks.  During the jog, I remember hearing a man say “les americans fait chier”...not a nice thing to say.  But how did he know we were American?  Then I notice she is wearing a grey t-shirt that says “army” and think about the fact that today is the 4th of July.  “Jen, you might want to turn your shirt inside o
