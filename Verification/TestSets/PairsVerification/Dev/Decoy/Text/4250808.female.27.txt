So i slept in this morning and that was great, i really cant remember the last time i slept till 10AM.Tish and i finished watching the movies we rented and then we got ready to run some errands and pick up Noah at 3.   Tish and i are going back and forth being really lovey to blah wit h each other and it is making me crazy. Not to mention the fact that yet agian she is hidding something and wont tell me about it. Why is my relationship so unsteady? I seriously go from be mad about her to mad at her in a matter of seconds. I dont know whats going on. I dont know how much more i can or even want to take at this point. If she is hiding stupid stuff from me than i can only imagine what else she is not telling me about. I just dont know i am so confused. I wish i had some friends here or my family.I am pretty sure if things with Tish dont work out that i will move back down to SO CAL.I hate to think like that but it is true.    I have nothing exciting to report about today. Maybe tomorrow... i have Noah all day i am hoping he is in a good mood so that we can go out and do something fun together. I really need to work on my report that is due on Tues. I think that maybe i have been putting it off more because i dont really like the class. I dont think i really want to be a medical asistant. I just wanna be a rock star.Why couldnt i have just been a rock star???? Is that really to much to ask?   I guess so.    Well i am off to confront Tish(i might be back later to blog about the fight)Why does love have to be so much work? I know that it takes some work but damn this is ALOT.   N
So today was suposed to be my "ME" day. I had it all planned out i was going to lounge,play with my sims,read,work on my website and just do whatever i wanted. It didnt turn out that way at all. This morning i was using the computer while Tish was getting ready for work and i opened up the notepad on MY desktop and found saw something called Darling. Of course i was like "whats this?"I opened it and to my total disgust it was a love email from my woman to her ex. It was an old letter but still i didnt need to see that shit. Just 2 days ago i came across saved IM's of theirs. I was furious,sad,and hurt. I called her in and she was just like "oh" like it was no big deal and when she said sorry it was so fake i couldnt even accept it. Now everyone has a past. Myself included i was in love once before but i really feel like her past is always b
