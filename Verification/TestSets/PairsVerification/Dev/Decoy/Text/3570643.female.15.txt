AP Euro was pretty fun cuz me and rae always laugh at the most random stuff and it is so funny! then lunch was same ol same ol. and chem was ok. it's dylans birthday today, Happy Birthday Dylan! then i went home and "did my homework" (i still haven't started). so ya onnly eight more days of school left! thats so cool! i am going to be aa fuckin junior, thats crazy! summer is going to rock! i am taking guitar lessons and i am going to surf camp with rae! i am going to miss kelly so much cuz that bitch is going to transfer to edison with all the druggies! jk kelly you're not a bitch i love you like a fat kid loves cake AND ice cream!well summer is near and its going to be good times!
