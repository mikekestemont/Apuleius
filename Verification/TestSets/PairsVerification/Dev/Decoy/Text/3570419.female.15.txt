it's practically a miracle that i'd ever post again, but strange enough, i am. vacation time usually pisses me off in some way or another. both sides of the family (mom's side, or dad's side) fighting for more time, or an alliance. screw them. then there's usually the day before we go to hilton head (ahem, today) where at first the adults are nice and sweet, then by night time, they're askin' u to get the hell down here and do somethin' for once in u'r life. trust me, u don't wanna know what it's like the morning we leave.   what's even more frustrating is only a days difference between each trip. now that could piss anyone off. i mean, i don't really care that much for tenn. and the beach is ok, but why the hell do they have to be right after another?  prolly the only good thing to think about is taking ryan on the beach and praying that he doesn't eat the sand, and hopefully eric will have left ashley by the time i've gotten back. i have no idea when he got back from nc, i pray it was today or yesterday.  well screw the blog, i'm sick of typing. look for another post in about a month or so...or when something dramatic happens. ~Annie
ok well, i don't really get why we have blogs or why we join one(unless u're ordered to), but i'll give it a try. blog is sucha ugly name noways. alright well, you've come here to find out a lil about me so here it goes...i'm 15(#24!), entering the 10th grade, and i go to wren high. who cares?  well let's go over a string of events. it's summer(thank god), so the only thing to do is go out w/ u'r friends right? you should go to los amigos, (while laughing at the one that burnt down) then walk over to a string of stores and get a guy to buy you movies, gum, and pretty pens. it's just the right thing to do. then of course after church you have to pack the truck up w/ 5 teenagers, and go to don pablos! first you annoy the waiter by not being able to order the 3 times he came, then you must leave, be scared to death while the driver is going 100mph on the interstate, and go to bilo. while you're in bilo convince one of your friends to get into a shopping cart and hold on to the back of the truck. yes and make it a sunday.  well some interests of mine are drawing, and writing. one day i hope to make some flashes, but not anytime soon, because that actually takes disapline, and sticking w/ your work...o yeah and having the flash program. so in the meantime i've dedicated my life to just do sports next school year.  ok well there's my first post, i'll prolly post again when i'm fussed at...
