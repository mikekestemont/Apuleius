Today was boring. I wore a skirt. That was a first.  ok after school I was going to my g-mas w/ my mom and we stopped at this stop light and there was a HOTT HOTT HOTT 16 or 17 yr old bside us and i glanced over and he was looking at me, but i went on talking, and my moms like "he was checking you out. . . .UR TOO YOUNG TO BE SCHECKED OUT!" Vierginia thinks its cause I wore this pink tank top and a shirt over it, and my hair dow. W/e. Anyway she left me to get a cd. *Sniff Sniif* how dare she leave me. lol anyway she is usually quite funny, it was gust yesterday she didnt put forth much effort. Oh well im not mad. l8er
Today was a total waste of make up. I was soe sleepy in school, I fell asleep in Mrs. Stoltfutz's class. She was pretty ticked but screw her. Im not their to shover my haed up their ass. I was really hyper this mourning. I had my own ashlee Simpson concert, inm wich I balireds the music for my family to rant an rave at me. yet again I'm not here to please them. Virginia wasn't hyper, which totally threw me off cause in Choir I was funny, and all she would doe was laugh, she never helped me out. Oh well. Im soe tired, and I want my mom to french braid my hair but i higly doubt that is gonna happen. L8er
My papaw is in Tipton Hospital. Earlier this year he had conjestive hart faliure. Well, he's filling up with fluid, wich is a sign of conjestive heart faliure, and he also has kidney infections. Im soe soe miserable cause Im soe close with him. And he about died earlier, soe I've appreaciated EVERYTHING he does. I gust hope to hell that he doesn't die on me. My mom is having sugery the 26th of this month and Im scared. My moms friend's son's friend shot hmslef in the chest and is in critical condition. His sister's best friend hung herself. God I soe hatwe this place. Everywhere I turn bad stufff is happening. I feel like everyone is turning their back when I need them most. Well thats all I wanted to say soe l8er.

And I'm prectally high on nyquil and pepto (Although Im not sure why my mom gave me Nyquil concidering its daytime, and the dayquil qwas right next to it.) God that pepto was horrible! I'm going to talk to Virginia and Micah before I get heavily influcenced and say something that doesnt need to be s
