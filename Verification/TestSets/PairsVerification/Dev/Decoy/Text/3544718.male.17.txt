Folks, I just wanted to let you know that the best way to waste your time is to do something that isn't useful... but you gotta have lots of fun doing it! Honestly, I've thoroughly enjoyed the time that I've spent on  urlLink The Homestar Runner Website . I've spent hours and hours looking at the  urlLink Strongbad e-mails , and they're pretty hilarious. If you don't know what Homestar Runner is, then when you have free-time, just visit the website. I've watched a few of the toons, too... they're pretty good. Anyways, that's my random rambling about Homestar Runner, I hope you're a happier person for it (under no circumstances are you to ignore your friends just to watch another cartoon... only watch it when you're bored and have nothing to do...). Ok, goodbye. urlLink

Every new day is a gift from God. Many times, I don't realize this, and I treat a new day as an obligation, rather than a gift. If you think of today as a gift, then you will be more likely to enjoy it for what it's worth.
Did you know that I just won a free SOBE on Sunday???  It was so awesome!  It said "Look under the cap to see if you have won!"  And guess what!?!?!
