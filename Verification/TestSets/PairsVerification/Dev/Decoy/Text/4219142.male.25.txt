earlier that night, and dammit if she didn't flip me out when I saw her start breakin'.  Girl was ill.  My boy Los was rappin' wit one chick and I saw Michiko by herself.  I started a lil convo and took off from there.  She was cool and we talked for a bit.  No flames between me and her, but I swear that Wendy was givin' me the eye, but she was there wit this dude, but I couldn't tell if they were together.  I might see her somewhere else later... Wendy, I got my eye on you, girl.      Anyway,  I just noticed it's 10 pm and I gotta check out Time Machine radio, so I'm out like Shout.  Remember, hold ya holds.  I will return to burn... Peace.

What up, peeps? It's ya man back in the house! Seriously, hello. I had a pretty uneventful weekend, and DAMN I'm depressed. I thought somethin' would come up, but it was not to be. Anyway, I did cop some new heat at Stacks today... The new Masta Ace is in stores, and all I got to say is run out and get it. Fan or non-fan, you got to hear it, it's pretty slammin'. It's worth it just for 9th Wonder's beat alone, but runner-up for best track on the LP was "Soda & Soap" produced by my man DJ Spinna. DAMN that beat is hot!!! Anyway, cop that there, it's a dope album. I also got that new 7L &amp; Esoteric, but I haven't heard it all yet. I peeped it at the store and what I heard was pretty good. Truth be told, I saw my main man J-Zone had a track on there and I had to get it, but there was some other heat on there, but I'll report on that when I hear the rest of the LP. B4 I go, I want to let y'all know that goin' down at Naga's in Long Beach is my two personal favorite DJ's, J-Rocc and Melo-D of the Beat Junkies on Wednesday the 25th. There'll be some other acts, but I'm gonna go see my boys spin. I met J-Rocc once, but I really didn't talk to him, but I talked to Melo-D a few weeks ago and he's a REAL cool brotha (and he represents the Latinos). If anybody's got the time, do yourself a favor and CHECK THEM OUT! I guarantee you they'll both rock the hell out da party and you won't be disappointed. I gotta jet, but I will be back. Hold ya heads... Peace      GO PADRES!!! (Even though they lost today...)        J-Zone: Yo, Celph, you better think twice before firin' that cannon, man      Celph Titled: I always do, Zone.
