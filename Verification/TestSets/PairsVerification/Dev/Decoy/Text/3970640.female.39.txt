– the more rotten they were, the better splat could be achieved.  But then someone got the braining idea to stab the apple onto the end of a stick and fling it at your enemy.  This worked great… but we got even more inventive!  Remember those long, orange, safety flags for bikes?  The poles were made out of a fiberglass sort of material.  If you rubbed the end just right on the sidewalk, you could make quite the spear.  And being fiberglass, they were more flexible than a stick, and boy could you get some fling action going!   I miss the days of the apple fights… sure there were tears, and yelling, and the occasional “I’m telling mom”, but by evening we usually all made up and were out with our flashlights for a rousing game of Flashlight Tag.   My daughter doesn’t play outside as much as I did when I was a kid…  of course, things don’t seem as safe now as they did back then.  We ran freely around the neighborhood, playing in the creek, sledding down the hills, jumping rope in the park,  biking around the town…  Wish somehow we could find that sort of freedom again.
When I was young I worked at our small town library.  Not much exciting happened there, but we did have this one patron who would sign his name and in one fluid motion draw a little hand holding a pencil at the very end of his signature.  All of us girly pages would squeal with delight when he entered the building and we’d all vie for the chance to check him out (his books!!) because then we could be close at hand when he wrote his famous (to us) signature.  It didn’t hurt that the man was good looking, but we really were interested in his signature too.  People don’t much care about their signature now a day.  You don’t have to sign for you books at check out – it’s all computerized.  I suppose celebrities practice their signatures, but that would be about it.  We’re in the computer age and your signature is a cute ditty at the end of your email.
Had a fantastic time away "up north". Didn't want to return, but alas I did have to go into work if I'm going to be able to afford more trips away in the future.  After all this relaxation, it was a real shocker to come home to a computer infected with Spyware. Tell me, who in the heck thinks up this crap?!?! There is one program on my computer that I did find a removal program for, however you actually have to buy it! I bet the same person/company made up the evil spyware and the fix. *sigh*  I have tried  urlLink Spybot S&amp;D  and  urlLink WebSweeper  with no luck. In my search for a "cure" however I have discovered quite a number of people in the same boat... I don't feel so alone :) Heck, check out  urlLink Keith Deven's  weblog! He's got a whole section devoted to s
