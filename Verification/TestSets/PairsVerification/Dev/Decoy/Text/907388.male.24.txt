Hi folks, this is maloy patnaik...22/m from india... i just started my blog..so give me sometime to get things moving... Meanwhile you may check out my website.. just started that too....  urlLink www.maloyvilla.com
Today is not a special day... but then i don't seem to be having very many special days, so ..... i guess that today was no different from others... Just got news from my boss that we will be working on a new project soon. Can't really tell too much about it here, but i guess the next few months are going to be pretty hard.  This year I am preparing for CAT again, so i do have a feeling that i am not going to have much leisure in the months to come. Last time CAT was good, but I missed on the last few steps.. here's hoping that this year will be smooth all the way. just talked to my friend Pritam .... i hope you know him.... Pritam Parija... my friend and partner... well he got his marching orders from TCS... will be joining training from early next month. One less friend around the city.... but then it's probably not such a bad thing after all. Forgive me if I'm blabbing. Here's wishing Pritam loads of luck for his new job... and for his special friend who seems to good to be true.... Watched Kalyan Singh taking oath of office and secrecy as the Cm of UP. I wondered as I saw him, what the world was coming to. Wonder how much he paid the BJP MLA's to defect. But judging by the looks of it, wasn't much probably... They were literally falling over themselves in return for a Ministerial berth. Maybe if I don't get a better thing to do, I'll probably join politics... I seem to have all the requisites... not that there are too many... Okay .. so until my next post... which will be pretty soon.... good bye and God Bless !!  And oh !! before i forget we will be shifting to our new home sometime next month. Will let you folks know about it...
Hi folks, Just updated the site.. added the stories section...will be awaiting your reviews.
Hi folks, The past week was witness to a really fantastic event. All of you should have known about it, but I wonder why none of the several news channels even bothered to mention it. Last week we had a meteor strike in Orissa.  Well it was huge, really huge. Imagine this, it is evening (around 6:30 pm) and suddenly the sky goes white. What would be you reaction? A fire cracker or maybe the ubiquitous electric transformer bursting perhaps. But what would you think, if your friend in another city, about 40kms away also saw the same thing at the same moment…. Actually that is exactly what happened. I was talking to my friend in another city when all of a sudden we see the sky turning white. We immediately knew that it was surely some kind of meteor strike. I remember w
