urlLink     Well, I have agreed a fee with the buyer and already solicitors are busying themselves passing bits of paper backwards and forwards.  Get this, the buyer, who is a local property speculator, doesn't even want to see the house let alone do searches or surveyors reports.  "At that price," he said. "I don't need to see anything".  Which gives me the same feeling as when I win at the bookies. Momentarily happy nefore the thought of how much better off I would have been if I'd opted for a higher stake.  In other words - if he was prepared to pay that price without even looking - the how much higher could he have gone?  Ah well. Bollocks to it. It's sold. That's the main thing. He said he can even give me a cheque inside a week. Fantastic.  Posts might be a little sporadic next week. I'm off on a VSO training course. On the other hand, they do have an internet and I'll probably be bored senseless so I may post more than ever.  We'll see.  But tonight, I celebrate.
urlLink     The downside of PR is that today I appeared in the newspaper. It was full or errors. The picture looked terrible and I sounded like a right yuppy prat.    The upside?    Well by 10am this morning this note was put through the door.     Hi *** from number *** here. I would like to make a cash offer to buy your house and could complete in a couple of days. I would exchange contracts immediately.      If you are interested please ring....   YESSSSS.
urlLink      Before I fly out to Hanoi, the biggest problem I still have to face is selling my house.      But today I had a brainwave.    Many years ago, in my days before switching to the dark side that is PR, I was a hack. One of my least favourite chores, week in, week out, was writing the bloody property section.    So I thought - why not drop them an email? I mean, "Geordie goes to Vietnam - needs to sell house quick," isn't such a bad story. Well, okay, by property press standards it's not such a bad story.    So I emailed them. Would they be interested in the story? Would they like me to write a press release? Can I arrange some pictures for them?    And guess what, they said yes, yes and we'll send our own photographer.      Bearing in mind that writing press releases is what I do for a living, it's nice to be able to write one about myself for a change. Only problem was - when I got to the sign-off stage I felt I needed extra reassurance. Typical. Finally a job when I don't have to clear everything with a client and I still need someone to say it's okay.    Anyway, I eventually told myself it was fine and forwarded it. Fingers crossed. If this gets a big splash in the property section then it might go along way towards selling the house.    I reckon if I could just shift the h
