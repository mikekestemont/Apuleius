paintings.  Lex said that if a person has the strenght of 10 men and can shoot fire out of his eyes he can be the most powerful man on earth.  He might even end up being a tyrrant.  The person who will try to challenge him is a very courageous man just to put him to right.  What Lex said really made sense to me that time.  I mean, what if there was no Lex Luthor to keep thinking of diabolical things to destroy Superman?  With all those powers and no one to use them against, surely the Man of Steel would have thought of other ways to use them...say rule the world?  Whenever there is a good guy there should always be a bad guy to balance things out.  But what if the good guy isn't the one with the super human abilities?  What if he's just an ordinary human being whose only power is his influence over so many things trying to stop this super being who comes to destroy the world?  Lex has a good point that the bad guy might not really be the destroyer of this super being but the super being himself.   Without Lex to do check and balance, the Man of Steel would surely use his powers to do a lot of bad things just to get what he wants.  If there wasn't a Lex Luthor who gives Superman a hard time, thinking of ways to retaliate where would our man of steel be? Will he really be this good guy everybody loves?  Lex has a really good point last night.  It would take a really brave man to go head to head with a man with the strength of 10 men.  But head to head he did hence the arch rivalry between Superman and Lex Luthor.  If you think about it, Lex is the hero because he sacrificed being good just so that Superman wouldn't turn evil.  Criminal mastermind? I think not, but a mastermind he is.  And a brave one at that. =)  Superman has always been depicted as the good guy, the boyscout, Mr. Truth-Justice in the American Way.  But if you think about it, if Lex Luther wasn't there to make him depict the boyscout image, Superman would just be one of your average super villain.  Hmm...Superman, a bad guy...that is not such a bad idea. =)  What do you think?
Hmm...well a lot of my friend know that I have a huge crush on this guy. I just found out that he got married yesterday.  Though it really saddens me that Kimi Raikkonen is married and not to me (as if I had a chance in the first place =p) I'm also happy for him. At least he found his special someone who he can live the rest of his life with. And that even if he wouldn't win the WC title this year, he knows that Jenni would still be there for him.      CONGRATULATIONS TO KIMI RAIKKONEN AND JENNI DAHLMAN!!! YOUR FANS ARE HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF Y
