Hey all, I've fixed up the Blog a bit.  Now people can put in comments and not have to sign up for a blogger account.  I realized that it was a bit of a pain to have to sign up for an account to put in a post.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in links and stuff to other people's blogs and whatnot.  I'm still new at this to bear with me.  Also, I had to get rid of all the other comments to previous posts.  Sorry about that.

Can anyone out there figure out what the reference to 7leafclover is from?

I have a few days still to go with CH and I never realized how much stuff I'd have to do to finish off work here.  It's just insane the amount of work I still have to do before I leave. I still have a few days so it shouldn't be a problem in getting it all done.  I completely trained my successor in financial coordinator duties yesterday.  She'll do fine as she has a good head on her shoulders and picked everything up pretty quick.  I'm not gonna have a whole lot of time to yap about things after this week unfortunately.  My access to the internet right now is limited to work.  We don't have the net at home yet and I think I'll only be able to get on if I go to the library.  Kate wants to get the net at home in September though when she can't move a whole lot and when the baby is born.  I'll try to show her how to do these blogs so she can keep people up to date with what's going on though.

This week isn't going to fun as I have to completely remove myself from CH.  I have a ton of stuff that I have to train people on before I go.  I have to train another staff here on financial coordinator responsibilities.  I find it a very easy role as I have been doing it now for 5 years.  I started typing out what you have to do each month and when I was all finished it totaled about 4 pages of stuff to do.  I'm currently on 3 different bank account and h
