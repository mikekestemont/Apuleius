I'm generally in agreement with the results of this test.  I'm not terribly Sociable, except with a few people I've checked out beforehand and decided are ok to do stuff with outside of whatever comfortable situation I've checked them out in.  (Nice sentence.)  That must tie in with Gregariousness.  Just the thought that I could have any element of gregariousness within me is laughable.  Now, I'm not trying to claim that I'm dull, or that I never make people laugh - that's not true, and some people think I'm hilarious.  But when I think of the "real me," my elemental self, it's rather more introspective than that.  Assertiveness.  74%.  That seems pretty high.  Maybe it's just that I have a low tolerance, particularly lately, for slack-assed behavior and attitudes.  But my so-called assertiveness comes out in a really pathetic way, more in the nature of backstabbing and whining than actually confronting problems.  Something to work on.  Activity level = 54%.  I'm not sure exactly what that's supposed to mean, but if it means I'm only active 54% of the time, it's probably right.  The other 46% of the time I'm sitting around reading novels & blogs, checking my email, watching TV, taking naps, talking on the phone or to colleagues, etc.  I'm not what you'd call "motivated".  Excitement-Seeking is deceptive.  Surely I  want  more excitement than 46% would indicate, but I'm also dragged down by some mitigating factors that are hard to fight, like a large amount of debt and some unreasonable personal responsibilities/agreements that limit my mobility.  I can't whine too much about my fate, but I can say that there's more to it than this indicates.  Enthusiasm = 46%.  Yeah, that's about right.  Less than half the time, things feel like they're worth getting off the couch for.  Or, more accurately, getting off of my [goddamned] Ikea  urlLink Poang chair  and  urlLink footstool  for.  Maybe I'm jaded, but I spent a lot of time when I was in high school and college getting very excited and pumped up about a lot of things, and those things never turned out to be worth the energy expended.  Trust = 42%.  This is exactly what the last sentence from the paragraph above is all about.  Nothing like getting burned to make one realize why touching fire is a bad idea.  Granted, when someone or something is worth it, it's all the sweeter.  But that's why it's rare.  Morality = 30%.  Does this mean that 70% of the time I'm immoral?  Or I make immoral choices?  Or I have immoral responses to simple questions?  Cause if that's true, what's the point of continuing?  No, seriously, I think it's probably because I don't agree with black-and-white  anything , and I don't agree that laws should be strictly enforced.  (I don't think that the Illinois ARDC would think too highly of that, but they should be more concerned with the death penalty, George Ryan, and Meg Gorecki right now to consider the musings of an inactive attorney who's never practiced anyway.)  Perhaps that section s
