any slower up here, I would be going backwards.&nbsp; I think I will love it!  &nbsp;  The house shopping has been going slowly, of course.&nbsp; We have found a few places that fit our needs, but were already sold.&nbsp; We have found another place that is still being built that is just the right size on just the right amount of land.&nbsp; We figure if we try and bid on it when it is still just a frame we may have a chance of snapping it up.&nbsp; Today we go out looking at houses again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
For the past two weeks I have been devoted fully to the hunt for a nice house.&nbsp; A house close to town with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a decent sized yard.&nbsp; Until this morning we had been looking at houses in the 160-180 range.&nbsp; Assuming that we could find something suitable, but not glamorous for that price.&nbsp; This is Alaska for the love of Christ.&nbsp; A state larger than Texas with fewer residents than the Dallas/Fort Worth area.&nbsp; There should be plenty of cheap land, right?   NO!&nbsp; WRONG!&nbsp; No land for you!   We saw cute little houses next door to apartment complexes with missing windows and cars junked in the front yard.&nbsp; We saw houses in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw houses with yards that would require hauling in tons (literally)&nbsp;of top soil to cover the gravel yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw fix'r up houses that I could pull the siding off of with my fingernail.&nbsp; The final straw came when we saw a perfect house, small but made for a couple.&nbsp; Large master bed and bath small side rooms.&nbsp; Nice lot, close to town...but when we went in the garage there was a giant tank of water.&nbsp; Apparently when&nbsp;a well has a low flow a "bladder" is used to collect water and store it until it is needed.&nbsp; The realtor told us not to worry, bladders had to be installed if the output of the well was lower than 3 gallons per minute.&nbsp; If it was a solid 2-3 gallons per minute and the well wasn't deep, it wouldn't be an issue.&nbsp; We checked the paperwork.&nbsp; The output was 3/4 gallons per minute and the well was 200 ft deeper than standard.&nbsp; The house could have run out of water .&nbsp;  The only house in our price range we liked  didn't have water. &nbsp;   We went home and rethought our plans and upped our housing allowance by 20,000 bucks.&nbsp; This morning we found the perfect house.&nbsp; Large lot.&nbsp; Awesome bedrooms.&nbsp; Giant kitchen with oversized side-by-side fridge.&nbsp; Mud room.&nbsp; Deck.&nbsp; I can not reveal the location of this house because it would completely jinx it.&nbsp; When our bid is accepted and our earnest money taken, I will put up tons of pictures.&nbsp; I am in charge of the financing as I understand money and Gabe is going to draw up our bid.&nbsp; The next step is shopping for furniture, appliances, and shoes.&nbsp; I firmly believe every house needs a few new pairs of shoes.&nbsp;   Wish us l
