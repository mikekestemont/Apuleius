Kunal Kohli's second offering (his first was Mujhse Dosti Karoge), Yash Raj Films' HumTum is a simple love story. It is the essential Bollywood formula love story, with a twist: Girl meets boy. Girl hates boy. Girl meets boy again. They fall in love.  The film opens at the airport with the protagonists, Karan Kapoor (Saif Ali Khan) and Rhea Prakash (Rani Mukherjee), leaving for New York. Rhea's mother, Parminder Prakash aka Bobby (Kirron Kher), is busy praying for her daughter's safety.  Karan is accompanied by mom Anu Kapoor (Rati Agnihotri) and good friend Mihir Vora (Jimmy Shergill). He believes that 'boys' and 'girls' can never understand each other, let alone be friends.  Both Karan and Rhea are seated next to each other in the aircraft, and the ice is broken. Karan shows Rhea his cartoon characters, Hum and Tum, the quintessential boy and girl who cannot live with or without each other!  At a stopover in Amsterdam, they explore the city and their differences together. Just as Rhea drops her guard around Karan, he kisses her, only to be slapped. They part on that sour note.  Three months later, they bump into each other at a New York park. Karan is with his girlfriend Shalini (Shenaz Treasurywala). Shalini and Rhea discover they are school friends. Rhea tells Shalini all about the Amsterdam episode, at the end of which Karan and Shalini split.  Cut to three months later, when Karan is back in Delhi with his mother. She is a wedding coordinator and ropes Karan in to help with a wedding. The bride turns out to be Rhea.  Karan bumps into Rhea again on a French train, where she cryptically tells him, "Samir is no longer part of my life." Karan lands up at his father's (Rishi Kapoor) Parisian house and tries to find Rhea.  Will Karan find Rhea? Where is Samir? Will they realise that they love each other? Will they be together? This constitutes the rest of film.  Hum and Tum, Karan's cartoon characters, pop up now and again. They experience the incidents that happen to Karan and Rhea — in animation.  This urban romance, which spans six years and many cities — Amsterdam, New York, Paris, Delhi and Mumbai — is an easy watch. The movie is essentially episodic in nature, and the episodes have been woven well together. The characters are also well defined.  There is a plausible, if simplistic, storyline. Like when Rhea alights from the train, she doesn't give Karan either her number or her address. Karan still traces her phone number and reaches her mother.  The film does s
