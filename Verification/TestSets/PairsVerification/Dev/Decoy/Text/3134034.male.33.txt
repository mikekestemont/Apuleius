gramatically right, but then again I believe that what they really tried to say is "MY opinion, which is also shared with..., I think, and some also think..., I believe and they also do...."   What WE call as "we" is a group of "I s" and "they" is a bunch of "yous". So, no more: Those Sundanese are really fond of sambal, you Irish are a crowd of drunkards.   All generalization is wrong, and why on earth did, again and again, I say "ALL generalization?"   Peace to you all, people with or without same opinion as mine.
My head is trying to kill me this morning.  I started the morning uneventfully. Waking up, rushing to back-bathroom (family bathroom was occupied), putting on my dull uniform, running to my car, waiting for my daughter preparing herself up for school, driving as fast as police allows to reach my angels' school, my wife's office, and my office in time.  Office, the annual report project was waiting for me and I thought I was ready for battle. All guns loaded, swords brandished, I tried to steal a bit of time reading several emails and browse. Browsing, and I got struck by thunderbolt.  Call it hollow stomach, subconscious mind, jealousy, lack of sleep, undetected tumor, or what have you. All I know, I felt that my head was trying its might to kill me, paralyze my body, holding me from finishing whatever I got in hand.  Two tablets of pain killer to the rescue..! They made it to fulfill their jobs swiftly. Headache, what headache? Smiles come up, new spirit is high and I am ready again for yet another battle: boooooredooom....
Just as I thought that I had made peace with my trueself...  ... Jealousy you tripped me up,  Jealousy you brought me down You bring me sorrow you cause me pain  Jealousy when will you let go?  ....  -Courtesy of Queen
Is it that easy to communicate? Say, you got the latest-state-of-the-art gadget i.e. cellular phone, iPod, PDA, internet messenger, even telepathy, or whatever say you. Will that be easy to communicate?   No, of course not. RIGHT, in order to do a communication process, not only YOU got the device, your counterpart also is required to have one (may that be same model, same system, or same protocol).   Granted, you both got ones. Now communication is underway. Hmmm... I still got something in mind that is nagging and I am sure that thing will hinder the process of communication to go on. One CAN make a connection. He/she can do it instantly once he/she has got the device that is required, rite?   WRONG! A got cellphone, B got the same, even with the same model. When A tries to contact B with his cellphone it now depends on B to decide a faith of the intended communication to happen, will B pick it up? will B ignore it? or will B be available at the time A is calling?  Gadget, ability, intention, timing. I am deprived of one of those, at least once in several a
