me. :) today was the first full day of school...it didn't completely suck...i got to hear about someone imploding their girlfriend's cat in the microwave..thats always fun.my voice is screwed up again..not a good thing.but thats life...
so yeah...i went to put in an application for a motlow class this morning...and the class was full.so i'm on the waiting list even though my gpa and act score are higher then the people in the class. yea yea the world hates me. les mis opens thursday and lets just say i'm nervous about that...the music is sloppy..i can't figure out my freaken music cue in one song. i have to go to school tomorrow for 2 hours..stupid school. the first full day is friday. haha my voice keeps breaking which is just beautiful since tonight is the last rehearsal before we open.jenna left me at the arts center again last night..the second time in less than a week.that kinda pissed me off. but oh well i might as well get over it. i got invited to join in the "happy ultimate frisbee game" today but i have a feeling i'm gonna pass it up.  frisbee's great i'm just not in the mood to go watch it since i'm a gimp and i can't run and play. haha but thats okay cuz matt invited me even though i'm "closer" to drew, chris,and i guess aaron even though he's been having worse mood swings than a woman lately. oh well i guess i'm off since jen wants me to go to wally world with her...
les mis opens thursday...agghh...we go back to school wednesday...tear...but any who...i went to the movies friday night to see the village. or atleast me,jen,britt, and julissa oh yea and noah went to see it. if you haven't seen it you prolly should.interesting movie.
