stupid cyber cafe... had like a paragraph written down before the pc decided to freeze on me... freakin a! oh well, drafted today finished second/third amazingly... another draft tomorrow i guess...  lets reconstruct what i wanted to say... you know how when u meet ppl and they're all the same and then you meet those one of a kinds whom you would really like to get close to, yet you fear that she'll see you as one of those normal ppl that she's used to? then when you do get a chance to be close and you open your mouth and all sorts of stupid things come out of your mouth becoz ur nervous around this person of intelligence and beauty... am i making sense ? how do you try to be yourself when you do not want to screw this one chance up? when you think that the true you moght not be good enough for this person. so you end up not calling her and she thinks you're just a flash in the pan. someone playing a fool... and who acts like an idiot... oh well... i'm rambling like a fool... if that person is reading this, i really do want to get to know you... and yes, you are quite show stopping... later...
have u ever been in a crowd of thousands and still felt all alone? have u ever been around the ppl u know and still couldn't relate? have u ever known love all around and yet still didn't feel secure? have u ever looked up in the sky and felt there's more to it that just fate? thats how i feel now...  have u ever smiled at a stranger and felt utmost satisfaction? have u ever gotten great hugs that u wish u don't have to let go? have u ever been woken up by the sweetest kisses you've ever felt? have u ever closed your eyes and just let the raindrops flow? it is the little things that make me happy...  sashi kumar balakrishnan 03.08.2004 â™¥  just felt like writing something... it's not tennyson, but it'll do right now... later...
if anyone was at the karnival sure heboh tv3 in bkt jalil last weekend then you would understand the title... the torture of being a dj and mc for three consecutive days yelling the same thing over and over again is crazy... also made me lose my voice... am now recovering from a bad sore throat, an insane flu and tired legs... it was fun though, and also earned me the money to pay for my rent... currently in whiny manja mode and missing my mom immensely. if i had a gf then i'd miss her too but alas, am not so fortunate, or maybe unfortunate... lol... l
