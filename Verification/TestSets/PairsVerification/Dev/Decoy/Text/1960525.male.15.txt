flunking in collage, and wasn't even making the rent from his pictures.  At his surprise b-day party we are reacquainted with his friends, the rich kid Harry and his romantic interest Mary-Jane.  The seemingly final straw in his life as Spiderman conflicting with his life as Peter is when he misses the a performance of MJ's play, and she is very upset with him and when is powers begin to fail on him he gives up his life as Spiderman and Peter Parker's life greatly improves.  He does well in school and finally makes it to MJ's play, and everything seems to be going better, except Harry wont let up with his vengeance of killing Spiderman as pay-back for his fathers death.  Once he learns that MJ is getting married, he crumbles again, soon a time comes when he realizes that he must be the friendly-neabiorhood-Spiderman.  It was both an action and a romance, but the sappy stuff was worth it to see Spidy get his ass handed to him by a six-armed villain.  All in all, you should see this movie, but don't stay till the end, there isn't anything special, I waited and found nothing, thanks.
I had marching band for the first time this year... dear go that is exhausting... 65 punds of metal on one shoulder, plus a giant reflective dish diverting sunlight to your face... whoo! its lots of fun1!! But i love it. So much fun for everyone!!!  Dont feel like finishing this  Later  -dustin
Okay, so none of us have been updating this lately, and that makes me kinda sad... We need to get back into this, people1!!11!!  --- So I ditched my old band, Fatal Error, because we had nothing going. Our keyboardist didnt have a keyboard, our drummer was a stoner, and my other guitarist moved away. Yeah... doesnt that suck? So now im starting one up with Jesse (my awesome little percussionist), Eric (The not-so-little bassist), Me (Sexiest guitarist on the planet earth), and maybe Matt (another guitar) but he kinda doesnt like me because of the whole "Lesa" ordeal. DAMN YOU WOMEN!!! I had this idea for an instrument for Jesse. So far I call it "The Station" because it's stationary (that means it dont move [or with difficulty]). Its like the Blue Man tubulum, but it will the hitting tube part thing infront of him with two toms on either side. The tubes lead up over his head, and just sit there. It's a good idea! Jesse says so! Damnit! --- I am soon going to be painting my room!!! Joy!!! Im gonna force Jesse to come over, and im gonna TRY to get Blanton to come over to help paint it. Yeah... it's gonna rock1!11!! I want to put a silhoette of my guitar on my wall, and then paint inside the name of the band. That would be neato! --- I just destroyed the whole purpose of this blog by putting in these updates, didnt I? Eh... oh well. If you have a problem with it you can S
